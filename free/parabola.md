# Parabola GNU/Linux 

[Parabola](https://parabolagnulinux.org/) is free (free as in freedom), simple
and lightweight GNU/Linux distribution.
  
_Isn't this same as yet another Linux distribution eg., Ubuntu or Fedora?_  
_Doesn't other Linux distributions free?_  
  

> Unlike, ubuntu and fedora, the parabola is based on the softwares that are
completely free. Which means all the software that runs on the Parabola
operating system follows guideline of free system distribution

*   > Have GPL compatible License

*   > Do not have non-free firmwares or blogs
    
_Aren't existing Linux distributions have above points covered?_  
_What softwares from other Linux distribution dont satisfy above condition?_  
  

> There is good long list of software that are in fact blacklisted because of
freedom issues. One can go through it from 
http://repo.parabolagnulinux.org/docs/blacklist.txt

  
_Whats left if one blacklists so many of softwares?_  
  

> Alternatives to all these blacklisted softwares are present (for most of
these). And with fully free softwares which intact our
[freedom](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw) one can perform their
computation.

  
Following is a snapshot from my home machine which has x86\_64 architecture.

```
yogeshp@localhost:~$ pacman -Ss freedom  
libre/your-freedom 20130629-1 (base) \[installed\]  
    This package conflicts with every nonfree package known to date to ensure your system is free.  
```
  
My parabola is sufficient to perform almost all the essential computation
activities. Eg. surfing Internet, Documents processing, Music & Multimedia with
keeping my freedom intact.
  
Be at rest, Be free and work. (Swami Vivekanand)
