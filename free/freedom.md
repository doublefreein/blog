# Free Software - It respects your freedom

> Can GNU/Linux be really run on school computers?


This was the question once asked by one of the school teachers to whom I was
giving a small talk about GNU/Linux and its power. They were OK with the theory
of four freedoms and their relation with GNU/Linux, but they were not convince
since they have never seen such system before. I promised them to present then
one of the GNU/Linux operating system in our next meeting.

  

I am a great fan of Archlinux because of its KISS concept and thus I opted for
Parabola GNU/Linux.

  

I went to main site of
[https://parabolagnulinux.org](https://parabolagnulinux.org/) and downloaded
graphical live ISO image from one of the near by mirror. Burned that ISO on USB
stick and boot my laptop with it to find if operating system can detect laptops
hardware. I could see nice LXDE login prompt with 'parabola' as the user.
Default passowrd is also 'parabola'. Once logged in, I could perform basic
sanity mainly browsing Internet and playing songs.

  

I then followed the steps mention
atÂ [https://wiki.parabolagnulinux.org/Installation\_Guide](https://wiki.parabolagnulinux.org/Installation_Guide)
and got my freedom on the laptop. Following are some screenshots for different
programs that can be configured on such system.

Even with all this, we are still scratching the surface. There is no limit with
what GNU/Linux can do. There are thousands of such GNU packages. One can get the
feel visiting
[http://directory.fsf.org/wiki/GNU](http://directory.fsf.org/wiki/GNU). Future
is full of freedoms and breaking of prisms or
