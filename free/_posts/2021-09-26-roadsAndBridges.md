# Review: Roads And Bridges by Nadia Eghbal

* Download this 145 pages book from
  [here](https://www.fordfoundation.org/work/learning/research-reports/roads-and-bridges-the-unseen-labor-behind-our-digital-infrastructure/)
  for free.
* This book dives in depth with the issues of free and open source software
  ecosystem; public digital infrastructure. The same infrastructure is currently
  powering the digital world from the stock market to newspapers to hospitals to
  space missions.

  ```
  Nearly all software today relies on free, public code (called “open
  source” code), written and maintained by communities of developers
  and other talents. Much like roads or bridges, which anyone can walk
  or drive on, open source code can be used by anyone—from compa-
  nies to individuals—to build software. This type of code makes up
  the digital infrastructure of our society today.

* Comparing digital v/s physical

| Public Infrastructures | Physical                      | Digital                                 |
| Examples               | Roads & Bridges               | Apps, Softwares & Internet              |
| Build Time             | Slow                          | Fast                                    |
| Cost                   | High                          | Cheap                                   |
| Rigidity               | Very high                     | Changes rapidly                         |
| Utility                | determined before building    | determined post building                |
| Managed                | Centrally by one organization | often distributed without any authority |
| Maintenance            | Low to none                   | very high                               |
| Life                   | Long; some 100+ years         | Short as ecosystem frequently changes   |

* Challenges
    1. Money has been taboo for the community
    2. No sustainable business model
    3. Most key projects have one/two developers
    4. No one wants to pay for the free open source software
    5. Maintenance is boring
    6. New society has fewer capable developers

* Hope
    1. Building awareness: Involving governments, institutions and companies to
       treat digital infrastructure as public good and take its ownership for
       long term maintenance.
    2. Measuring usage and impact of digital infrastructure; then to track and
       improve.
    3. Encouraging standardization across open source projects
    4. Expanding pool of open source contributors

* What can we do
    1. Contribute regularly; code, document, donate or share
    2. Demand our institution, company and government to support open source by
       - using/creating/maintaining open source projects
       - donation
       - sponsoring developers
       - join [TODOGroup](https://todogroup.org/) and start a [open source
         program](https://todogroup.org/guides/)
