# Free Software Movement

This was created by [RMS](http://www.stallman.org/) in year 1983. Free software
is software that respects users' _**freedom.**_ Opposite of free software is
non-free software; or proprietary software.

This non-free software _steals_ users' freedom keeping them

1.  **divided** :- Users are forbidden from sharing the program.
2.  **helpless** :- Users don't have the source code of the program.


Free software have four _freedoms_

*   **freedom 0** :- to run the program for any purpose.
*   **freedom 1** :- to study the source code of the program and change it to
    make it do what you wish.
*   **freedom 2** :- to make and distribute exact copies of the program whenever
    you want. or help your neighbours.
*   **freedom 3** :- to make and distribute copies of your modified versions of
    the program.

 And this is why _school should run only Free software_

1.  Obvious reason is to **save money**. Schools don't have enough money, so
    they shouldn't waste their money paying for permission to use proprietary software.
2.  To form **good programmers**, because in order to learn good programming
    skills students need to read lots of code and write lots of  code.
3.  To teach good citizenship, because schools have the mission to teach not
    only facts and technical skills, but above all the spirit of good will, the
    **habit of helping others**.
