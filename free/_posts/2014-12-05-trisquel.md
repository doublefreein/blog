# Trisquel GNU/Linux

[Trisquel](https://trisquel.info/) is a GNU/Linux and is a Free
(Swatantra/Libre/Freedom) Software.


Just like Parabola, its also listed in on official GNU page as [GNU/Linux
distribution](http://www.gnu.org/distros/free-distros.html).


Trisquel, a GNU/Linux distribution based on Ubuntu that's oriented toward small
enterprises, domestic users and educational centers.


Yet another Free alternatives for users using Ubuntu ([Ubuntu is not a Free
Software).](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/ubuntu-spyware.html)

Another good thing about Trisquel 7.0 is its LTS and hence will be supported
for next 5 years (Till 2019/2020).
