# Fasting: Beginner's experience

Following is my experience with the series of quick fasts that I have done recently.
I am just a beginner and do not claim to be an expert in the field; kindly explore at your own risk.

Recently a few friends from the [runners community](http://ncrunners.in/) did a 24 hours fast and
can be easily done by most if they follows these steps

1. Have a healthy diet a couple of days before the fast. Avoid sugary, oily or junk food.
2. Set a time goal; track the time. There are so many free apps on the Internet; I would recommend [zero calories fasting tracking app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zelo_fasting.zelo&hl=en_US&gl=US) this works well on [firewall](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.greyshirts.firewall&hl=en_US&gl=US)
3. Keep drinking water regularly. Target 3.5 to 4 litres. Add a Cardamom for taste (or green tea), optional.
4. Avoid physical exercises during the fasts; short walks are fine.
5. Utilize the time saved by skipping the meals for thought provoking activities like reading, meditation or listing good podcasts.
6. Break the fast by consuming a bowl of boiled Mug (Green-Gram) and consume regular food after a couple of hours.

There is a lot happening in the body<sup>([^FastingStages])</sup> when we stop eating; idea is not test the
limit of our body but at least touch the surface of its power

Anyway, we did our first 24 hours fast; I did not feel any headache during
the fast. But while breaking the fast I ate spicy potatoes and sweet lime. Then
after an hour or so I noticed a headache and acidity. Well drank a lot of water
an hour after and a light meal resolved it.

Later I did a couple of intermittent fasts of 16 hours; the eating window was 9 AM to
5 PM. Felt good and light after it; even did running of 5km before breaking it
and things were fine.

Did an Ekadashi fast, 11th day of 14 days lunar cycle, with conventional timing;
didn't eat anything on Ekadashi day (or night). This fast went for 34 hours and
consumed nearly 4+ litres of water (with cardamom for taste). During the meal time
when the urge was highest, I had warm water. And broke the fast with boiled
Green-Gram (Mug); never before enjoyed Mug so much. Felt much lighter, calmer
and better after the fast. Utilized the gained time reading books and blogs.

I feel running and fasting have similar post-event experiences. Runner's high makes them more open and expressive; some feeling
of achievement. I have observed the same behavior with the members after completing
the long fasts 18hrs+. I believe this might also be related to [endorphins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endorphins), hormones released by our body in response to pain.It helps positively to destroy anxiety and depression; it is a natural feel good drug.
Off Course, google will throw a result for every random search like this [endorphins fasting](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2289782/) :D.
Overall the experience was good and I urge people to try it and share their experience.
