# Independence Day Celebration

Organized a few events on the occasion of the 75th independence Day celebration
at our housing society. Intention was to strengthen the community.

## Posters Presentation

I had received a random forward on whatsapp about how Ganesh/Ganapati idols
created from plaster of Paris or Shadu sand/soil combined with chemical colors
cause harm to the rivers and destroy the ecosystem based on it.

Contacted the NGO working for the cause and luckily they were from the same
town. [jeevitnadi](https://www.jeevitnadi.org/)'s website has some resources
for more people to become involved for the cause. One of the lists was a bunch
posters which could be displayed. Contacted the concern person and booked the
posters for the independence day event at the society.

It was displayed from 14th August till 15th August in the society's clubhouse.

##### Thanks to

- Ajinkya (Ajya) for forwarding the video.
- Niranjan Sir from Jivit-Nadi to making the posters available.

## Drawing Activity

This year, in June, our society lost a child in an accident in front of
society's premises and it was a shock for our entire society. Seniors/Elders
over time got over it but children had that fear still in mind. So we wanted an
event where elders can communicate with the kids and give the safety first
message.

To gather kids just for this was a challenge and most would not have come. Hence
thought of organizing some events for kids.

Because many children had some activities lined up in their school on the 15th of
August, a day before it (Sunday, 14th August) was selected for the activities.

15 people had registered online for the event but on the event day 31 children
showed up from different age groups.

Here a few of their drawings.

## Flag hoisting

Unlike the previous years, this year we decided to hoist our own flag.

BTW, the entire flag hoisting event was organized by the society committee. I
personally helped only in getting the Khadi flag and hoisting it.

Getting the flag was a challenge and luck too. Visited four khadi gram Udyog
outlets, a couple of wholesalers and a few post offices  but couldn't get it.
Finally, I made up my mind to buy cloth and stitch it myself and went to a khadi
outlet to get the cloth and there it was; a khadi tiranga waiting to be waved at
our society.

## My Feedback

1. Very few individuals took the initiative to organize this event so not much
   creativity was seen; being it the first time people might ignore it but for
   future events involvement of more individuals is must.
2. No involvement of youngsters; teenagers or even kids in twenties must
   associate early in organizing the events like this.
3. The event like this should be organized on the money contributed by the members
   as donations. This is a very essential step for long term sustainability of the
   event for years to come.
