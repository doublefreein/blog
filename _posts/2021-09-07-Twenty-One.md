It started from  their Jeep, with number plate 5021, which is considered as the
most lucky vehicle that they have ever possessed.  Not having an accident,
better mileage, giving a predictable behavior, and not giving major maintenance
work made it so. They gave credit to the  last two digits of its number plate,
**21**. So now they assume that it is number 21 which makes the thing better.

When family business is in construction domain and when family is joint
generally there are 10 bikes, 4 cars and 4/5 construction machines. Most of the
personal vehicles have *5021* in RTO number or *XX21*. But this choice adds many
restrictions sometimes. Like, many a time we have waited for many months until
the number series is available.

This number choice doesn't restricts to cars but then phones/mobile numbers and
flight seat numbers or rounding transaction such that *21* is part of it.

But this bias about numbers grabs attention everything it appears anywhere.

Eg., I found this excellent book which explains Bitcoin so well and its named as
[21 Lessons](https://21lessons.com/).

The number has some mathematical properties [21
Number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/21_(number)) has a special page on the
wikipedia.

It mentions the number is
[Fibonacci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number), Triangular Number (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6) and many more special properties.

BTW, both summer/winter solstices fall on 21st June and Dec respectively.

Finally, for crypto enthusiasts, the total number of Bitcoin to be released is
21 million.

The number 21 has also [significance in Hindu
scriptures](https://crossasia-journals.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php/ejvs/article/viewFile/396/391)
and [in the worship of Lord
Ganesha](https://bhargavasarma.blogspot.com/2013/09/significance-of-21-in-worship-of-lord.html).
