I remember seeing a chart like this in the book 'The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People' by Stephen Covey. Actually, this matrix is called the Eisenhower Matrix (named after the 34th U.S. President) and was later adapted into productivity systems, including Coveyâ€™s book.

1. Spending time in Q-II should be the goal.
2. Handle Q-I smartly and promptly, and aim to reduce it over time to avoid burnout.
3. Q-III is where delegation or offloading should be practiced.
4. Q-IV should be avoided or kept to a minimum.

If you find yourself feeling drained, frustrated, stagnant, bored, or undervalued in your professional life, it's likely because you're spending time in every quadrant except Q-II
