I remember seeing chart like this in book 'The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People' by Stephen Covey.
Actuly this matrix is called as Eisenhower Matrix (34th US President) and later adapted into production systems and thus in Covey's book.

1. Spending time in Quadrant II should be the goal.
2. Handle Quadrant I smartly and promptly, and aim to reduce it over time to avoid burnout.
3. Quadrant III is where delegation or offloading should be practiced.
4. Quadrant IV should be avoided or kept to a minimum.
