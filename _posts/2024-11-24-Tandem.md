desc: My Experience with Tandem Cycling
---

Today, a few of us cyclists from [NCRunners](https://ncrunners.in) had the
unique opportunity to experience tandem cycling. Though the ride covered a
modest distance of 25 km, the format made it truly special.

A tandem cycle requires two riders: a captain and a stoker. What made our ride
remarkable was that the stokers were all blind. Our group provided 8 tandem
cycles, with 8 captains from NCRunners partnering with these incredible
individuals.

The pedals on tandem cycles are synced, making balance and coordination crucial.
Maintaining stability required constant communication with our partners,
especially regarding pedal positioning. Since the stokers couldn’t see, captains
had to guide them through the ride, alerting them to obstacles, ascents, or
descents, and providing instructions when applying brakes or shifting gears for
extra power.

My partner was 100% blind since birth, yet had graduated in IT and was pursuing
a career in accessibility testing. They had participated in several tandem rides
before and were instrumental in helping me understand how to captain
effectively. Tandem cycles are long, making sharp turns or quick swerves
difficult and best avoided. The seats are also set slightly lower to minimize
the risk of tilting, especially important when the stoker is blind.

During the ride, I noticed how often we reference visual objects in our daily
conversations—colors, shapes, or sizes. This made me more conscious of my words
and mindful of avoiding visual analogies.

What struck me most was their extraordinary hearing abilities. My partner could
pick up on the smallest sounds—the click of gears shifting, vehicles
approaching, or even the cheers and conversations of people around us. Their
heightened auditory sense was truly remarkable and inspiring.

This experience was more than just a ride—it was a lesson in trust, teamwork,
and adapting to new perspectives. Tandem cycling showed me the strength of
connection and how much we can learn from each other when we share the journey.

Thanks to NCRunners' cyclists (Omkar, Sangram & Suhas) for inviting
[ABBF](https://abbf.in/) to organize this wonderful ride. Finally, heartfelt
gratitude to my tandem partner for sharing a few unforgettable life lessons with
me.
