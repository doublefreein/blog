of my reasons. To know his reasons go through

Not-using-FB will, at least, save some of your time from getting wasted and one
can channelize that for some better activity.

For students who are keen on exploring and learning, I can think of so many
better internet activities than Facebook. Following are some of them

    is [free software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html)â€”it respects
