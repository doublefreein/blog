# Aabaji

I have never met/seen my grandfather (Mother's Father). He died before I was ever
born. They say he was a great jockey but I never used to believe them because,
generally, parents tell about their parents with some added Masala. But one
day, while going through some old material at my Mom's house I found a
newspaper cutting dated `25th March 1943`. It was from *Sporting Times*.

At the age of 26 **Vithal Ramchandra Jadhav** has joined the roles of leading
jockey in western India. This Maratha lad apparently seed to Krishna Bapu, the
Kolhapur trainer from his youth says he owes his success to encouragement and
help given by the late Maharaja of Kolhapur and S. S. Akka Saheb Maharaj.
Krishna Bapu must be given up the credit of providing with the opportunities to
show his skill in the saddle, these readily grasped by Jadhav who early in his
career demonstrated that he had the right temperament of a quiet disposition.
Jadhav, he is not the type of man likely to be spoiled by success.
In Madras, Maysor, Kolhapur, Pune and Bombay Jadhav has ridden winners which
goes to show that all course scores come to him. This is the acid test of
horsemanship.

By such a statement it is not meant to imply that Jadhav is a finished product
and has nothing further to learn. He admits that he is gaining experience
everyday and has picked up sub useful tips from the leading European
professionals who are his colleagues.

He is the retainer offered to Jadhav by H. H. The Maharaja of Kashmir during
the Bombay season brought the Indian jockey in to prominence. He had justified
the confidence placed in him by winning the western India Cup on Pierot , RAF
cup (division 2nd) on *Limejuice*, Army and Navy Cup on Engaged and Colaba Cup on
Gloaming for his sporting pattern this season. Jadhav considers Gloaming to be
the best horse he has ever ridden.

During the Madras season he won 11 races which included 3 cup events including
Smokey Sea on which he scored at Mysor returned a dividend of RS 645. Others
well known horses on which Jadhav has been successful are *Farooq Pasha*, *Black
Magic*, *Mark You*, *Salman Bar*, *Night Alarm*, *Toltec* and *Master Mint*.
He can go to scale at 7-7 and as he is strong at that weight. These services
are much in demand. Jadhav career future will be watched with interest by
racegoers on this side who are mighty pleased and see an Indian boy make it.
