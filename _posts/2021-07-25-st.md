[Strength](Strength) Training (ST)
======================

What
----

Strength Trainings (ST) are equally important as long runs while preparing for any long running event like HM/FM. It builds muscles which are then consumed during the runs and there by preventing injuries.

For stronger and better runs, have ST sessions regularly.

Time
----

From what I learned from doing/taking ST at [NCRunners](http://ncrunners.in) running group. This group is run by 100% volunteers in Nanded City, Pune.

*   STs generally happens twice per week
*   They are 90-100 mins sessions
