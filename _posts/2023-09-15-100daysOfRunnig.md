### What?
Today marked my 99th consecutive run, and my goal is to run for 100 days straight.

### Why?
For the same reason people run marathons:
- To challenge themselves; long-term goals inherently contain challenges.
- To fight boredom.
- For fun.

### How?
I ran a minimum of 2.5 km every day, which took me 16-20 minutes, and I did it
barefoot. On some days, I targeted longer runs of 10-18 kms.

### Any takeaways?
1. I aimed to time my 100th day run on my birthday but missed it by two days.
   The reason for this delay was the initial challenge of starting. The biggest
   obstacle to our goals or aspirations is often not the physical effort but the
   mental barriers.
2. Keeping a public journal helps, especially in the initial phase (the first
   20-30%). This makes you more committed to the action and assists in forming a
   habit.  [See Atomic Habit review](https://yogeshpowar.github.io/blog/2021/12/31/atomicHabits.html)
3. Unlike our usual routines, I minimized preparation before each run. I ran
   barefoot, no Garmin - no sync, reused my running kit for 2-3 runs, replaced a
   separate warm-up with a slow first 500 meters run, quick stretches (with
   fewer exercises and repetitions), and took a quicker cold-water shower.
   Typically, these activities took 40-45 minutes.
4. There was a three-month break before I started this challenge, during which I
   had an unhealthy diet. However, I could feel my body getting into shape as
   early as the first week. Most of the cleansing had occurred by the time I
   reached 15-20%.
6. A good 20-minute run can also induce the Runner's High, a brief and deeply
   relaxing state of euphoria, which is an intense feeling of joy and delight.
   So, beyond the physical benefits, this activity had mental advantages.
7. Since these runs were solo and of short distances, I didn't focus much on my
   running form. Instead, I enjoyed the sights and observed my surroundings,
   people, animals, and nature. They were certainly stress-busters.
8. As an flag bearer of barefoot running (after all, no one is born with shoes), I
   wish the entire world would embrace barefoot running. It's healthy, safe on
   well-maintained roads, and immensely satisfying.


Finally, as always, thank you to everyone who supported me in achieving this
goal.

Happy Running!
