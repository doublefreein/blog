There are four types of schools in India

1. **Government Schools**: Either built on government land or on donated land;
   managed and run by the government. Teachers' salaries and operational costs
   come from the government.
2. **Private Aided Schools**: These schools are not owned by the government but
   by a trust, society, or section-8 company. The government recognizes these
   schools and also gives some aid to them. Although ideally managed by a
   private body, the government intervenes and manages teachers' appointments
   and salaries.
3. **Private Unaided Schools**: Recognized by the government but not provided
   any financial aid. Such schools are entirely run by private management,
   funded through school fees and donations. The government ensures that 25% of
   seats are reserved for economically backward or reserved castes & tribes.
4. **Private Unaided Unrecognized Schools**: These schools are not recognized by
   the government and thus do not receive any aid. They don't exist on paper,
   making it impossible to obtain a board certificate or apply for board exams
   through these schools. They mainly exist for students seeking a different
   educational experience, possibly focusing on specializations. They serve as
   an ideal stop for homeschooling children willing to appear for board exams by
   filling form No. 17. We also discussed this in the [previous blog](https://yogeshpowar.github.io/blog/2023/11/28/IndianEducationSystemIII.html).

The government, which spends nearly about 3% of GDP, aims to reach 6% according
to The National Education Policy, 2020 ([^NEP]). As a regulator, it keeps
shuffling the order to enforce quality, transitioning from aided to unaided or
from recognized to unrecognized.

Parents with access to resources (read wealthy parents) prefer Private Unaided
Schools. Due to competition in such schools, availability of teachers for low
salary, better facilities (read amenities), and brand reputation attract more
parents to these schools. It's now also considered a status symbol. The movie
[Hindi Medium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindi_Medium) has covered this
story. More than 40-50% of students in urban areas are studying in private
unaided schools ([^PSP]).

Government schools suffer from low attendance, and many exist only on paper.

Private aided schools have little autonomy and no competition (or death) since
teacher salaries are funded by the states, bypassing private management.

A non-traditional school must begin its journey from becoming a private unaided
unrecognized school towards becoming a recognized or aided one. Solutions
offered for the [problems of the Indian education system](https://yogeshpowar.github.io/blog/2023/11/25/IndianEducationSystem.html)
must first gain acceptance from society (perhaps from parents willing to support
unrecognized schools) and should be self-sustained.

To see results, a school must institutionalize and think beyond the passion of
one or two teachers.
