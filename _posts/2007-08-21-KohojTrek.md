It was mid September and I was told to organize a trek for the CS department
[junta](https://www.iitbombay.org/page/iitb-student-lingo) as Annual CSEA
department trek. As it was a department trek, I was forced to choose a location
with moderate difficulty level. After going through much of the resources from
the Internet, I selected Kohoj Fort as the final destination. 30th September was
the date fixed for trekking, so on 23rd September we ( Sobhan and I ) decided to
visit the place just to confirm the correctness of the data that was collected
from the Internet. There we found that reaching the top is impossible without
the help of natives. So we hired one of the native boys who said he was familiar
with the path to reach the top.

While descending we had to paint the arrows on trees/rocks as navigators to
avoid junta taking wrong routes.

On the final trekking day there were 103 UGs and PGs. The people for whom we
selected an average trek instead of a difficult one were professors and their
families; and NOT A SINGLE one of them had come for the trek. Maybe they wanted
to respect our privacy. Following is the trek summary
