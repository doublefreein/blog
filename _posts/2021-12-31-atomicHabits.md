# Atomic Habits

The book provides easy ways of building good habits and breaking the bad ones.
The author even claims that the ways are proven by backing each with
some event from history. The author is not a scientist and doesn't propose any
new theory based on empirical data.

Central idea of the book is
[this table](https://s3.amazonaws.com/jamesclear/Atomic+Habits/Habits+Cheat+Sheet.pdf) (printable
pdf from the official site) on how to create a good habit and break
bad one. And its derived from four step model

| | To create a good habit | To break a bad habit |
| 1. Cue      | Make it Obvious        | Make it invisible    |
| 2. Craving  | Make it attractive     | Make it unattractive |
| 3. Response | Make it easy           | Make it difficult    |
| 4. Reward   | Make it Satisfying     | Make it unsatisfying |

1, 3 and 4 were very common and the author added the 2nd step. [Here is a
video](https://youtu.be/Q8ApZXWgJq4?t=1136) of the
author saying the same.  If any of the steps is missed then habit is not created
or broken; the things will not come automatically.

The book is full of quotes. Many have gathered from other scientists and authors too.
Following are some quotes and snippets which I found interesting

1. *Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you
   will call it fate* - by Carl Jung
2. *We have the brains of our ancestors but temptations they never had to face*
3. *The costs of your good habits are in the present. The costs of your bad
   habits are in the future*
4. *The road less traveled is the road of **delayed gratification***
5. *Habits are the entry point, not the end point. They are the cab, not the
   gym.* WRT a famous dancer who used to work our daily and the habit used to
   start from hailing a taxi.
