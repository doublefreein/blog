desc: Mahalaxmi Darshan must be open to all

I recently visited the Mahalaxmi temple in Kolhapur, also known as Ambabai
(आंबाबाई), and I was surprised to see that common people didn't have access to
the Darshan Mandap. I saw a couple inside it and hence I approached the management
committee to request a pass, but they informed us that it's not open to all.

When we pointed out that we saw some people inside along with the guard, they
explained that they must have had references from a Pujari (priest) to gain
access.

I can understand that the Gabhara (गाभारा), where the deity stands, is a sacred
place and should be maintained with utmost sanctity and could be kept out of
reach from the common devotees. However, it's not clear why the same
restrictions apply to the Darshan Mandap (दर्शन मंडप).


Given the temple's long history of over 1200 years and the age of the deity,
which is believed to be 2000-3000 years old, the temple management should not be
short-sighted, arrogant, or assume they are the sole owners of the temple.

People stand in long queues for a considerable amount of time to get Darshan,
and it's essential not to play with their devotion by only providing the "Mukha
Darshan" (मुख-दर्शन) from a distance. Everyone should have equal and fair access to the
Darshan Mandap to experience the divine presence up close.


PS:
Unlike many other Hindu temples, here no one asked for any money or donations
and I would kudos the temple management for it.
