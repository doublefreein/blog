Politicians are often drawn to involvement in schools and educational institutes
due to various reasons. Commerce plays a significant role in this interest,
manifesting through several means:

1. **Land investments**: Often involving black money transactions, these deals
   capitalize on land appreciation. The sales deed might involve only a portion
   of the payment made through legitimate channels, reducing tax or concealing
   the actual source.
2. **Forced donations during admissions**: As schools evolve into colleges and
   specialized institutions, these donations can reach millions.
3. **Cross-selling opportunities**: Schools serve as a platform for selling
   various products and services, from uniforms and stationery to transport and
   travel services.
4. **Government grants**: Schools capitalize on government grants, using them as
   a significant revenue stream. These resources, intended for beneficiaries,
   don't always reach them entirely.
5. **Influence on staff appointments**: Teacher or staff appointments often
   involve donations or portions of their salaries being diverted as
   commissions.

This connection frequently intersects with political motivations,influencing
students and parents for vote bank capture. Institution staff may also be
utilized for political work, essentially acting as unpaid party members.

_The core issue here lies in significant investments made with the intention of
securing a better future, yet through corrupt, illegal, or unethical means_. This
corruption ultimately impacts the quality of products and processes within these
institutions.

One potential solution lies in schools operating without any grants or favors
from the government. This approach could eliminate bureaucratic hurdles and red
tape. However, this raises questions about non-government recognized schools,
especially concerning Xth or XIIth board exams and admissions to other schools.

For board exams, [Form No. 17](https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/pune/maharashtra-form-no-17-private-ssc-hsc-candidates-online-september-16-7499619/)offers
a solution, allowing any student to be eligible for exams by filling out this
form. Additionally, regulations around [homeschooling in India](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/how-to/is-homeschooling-valid-in-india-legal-status-and-practical-challenges/articleshow/99194337.cms)
also provide an avenue for admissions to other schools when transferring from
non-government recognized institutions.

However, recognized schools by the government play a crucial role in enforcing
regulations that ensure management completes mandatory activities set by the
board or regulatory bodies. In the case of non-government recognized schools,
this responsibility falls on parents. They must diligently monitor their child's
progress, constantly requesting updates and ensuring progress from teachers and
management.

In conclusion, a way forward exists through non-government recognized schools
aligning their standards with their recognized counterparts, with dedicated
teachers and vigilant parents undertaking the role that the government typically
plays in ensuring quality education.
