        Initially road was ok but after an hour of riding we came to know why
        internet says its hard to pass Rohtang; One feet muddy roads, Traffic
        Jams, Road block because of melting of ice, 45 degrees roads ;) and
        chilling cold. Every time our shoes got wet we had to replace socks and
        if possible shoes. Encountered little snowfall on the top. Had to
        tighten clutch cords twice while crossing the pass.
    *   16:00 Had lunch after descending the Rohtang on the other side. Typical dal rice.
    *   18:00 Removed Puncture of one the Unicorns.
    *   18:15 Started from Keylong. It get dark little late there. We decided to
        cover 45 Km in the evening/night. Road was risky but had no option of
        staying anywhere on the road; It was damn cold.
    *   21:30 Reached Keylong and found a hotel for shelter ;). Then as usual
        food + Old Monk :) and good night sleep
*   19 June 2009
    *   12:00 All bikes were made tank full as next petrol pump was 365 KM away
        :O. Had go back 7 Km for finding the petrol pump from Keylong. My
        bullets clutch plate was in bad condition, had to throttle a lot for
        steep rise and also there was only one mechanic @ Keylong, also named
        Yogesh, and was overcrowded. So decided to stretch the bikes till Leh.
        We had left with very little cash, as our assumption of finding an ATM
        at Keylong was wrong. We borrowed some cash from hotel owner instead of
        paying him the hotel and food bill. Such nicer people will only find in
        that areas.
    *   2:00 Started for Leh and decided to reach Sarchu by EOD.
    *   5:00 Had to stop at a tent near Zinzunbar as road ahead was blocked due
        to avelanche. There was all ice outside the tent. Some how manged to get
        Dal-Rice for dinner in the tent itself. Night was terribly cold, owner
        said temperature that night was -10 degrees :(. Rahul had breething
        problem. Many had headache, cold and
        [![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_hiiwYtuYGgs/SucIM3IMDiI/AAAAAAAAAsY/xBbyUxSqjU4/s200/img_1737.jpg)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_hiiwYtuYGgs/SucIM3IMDiI/AAAAAAAAAsY/xBbyUxSqjU4/s1600-h/img_1737.jpg)running
        nose. Blankets were not that woolen. Had use the sleeping bags that we
        carried with us. We all were waiting for Sun to rise so that we can
        start. And this how one of buffer day was used at Zinzunbar.
*   20 June 2009
    *   9:00 left Zinzunbar. Road was covered with Ice @ many places. Helmet
        visor were used with vapours; If we keep it open, there was chilling
        cold wind hitting the face. My bike go sleeped over a ice block after
        crossing Barallachla. Cloths got wet, wanter went inside shoes. Had to
        cross many water streams flowing across the road.
    *   11:30 Reached Sarchu. Had lunch, dried our cloths, shoes and socks.
        Rahuls breathing problem was still there, more than that, he was
        vometing everything that he ate.

        only 80 Km in whole day. :(. That night was better that previous.
*   21 June 2008

        washing our hands on previous night was literally frozen by next

*   25 June 2009
    *   10:30 Started for Jammu. Road's quality was good as its a national
        highway but all the road is actually a ghat, only curves.
    *   18:00 Reached Jammu.
*   26 June 2009
    *   Seen some fort of Jammu. Went for search of Bike transport services.
        Sent our bikes to Pune via TCI-XPS for avoiding damages than sending it
        through the train (Realized that it was a bad decision, as both bullets
        were severely damaged when we got the bikes in Pune that too after 15
        days :(). And we started our roaring train journey to Pune with nothing
        but the sweet memories of Beautiful valley.
