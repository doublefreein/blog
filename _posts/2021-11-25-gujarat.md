# Road Trip to Gujarat

Total 12 Days of unplanned road trip to Gujarat driving ~3000 km. Along with
pilgriming many religious places, seen a few museums, a science center, many
historical places, a palace, a jungle safari, visiting a milk product
factory and finally shopping at a wholesale textile market.

The experience was awesome and I recommend it for all; especially to **Maharashtra's
politicians and leaders**.

## Day 1
* Pune to Nandigam: 300 km
    * Started late from Pune 1500; unplanned trips have starting problems ;)

## Day 2
* [Shri Simandharswami Jain Tirth - Nandigram](https://goo.gl/maps/wLwa64gcsZbP2Sw8A)
* Nandigam to Chotila: 500 km
    * A forced stop because a tyre burst; under construction a new road has it's own
      problem. Spare tyres (Stepney) these days are smaller and have speed restrictions.
      So we stopped at the nearest town.

## Day 3
* Chotila has a [Chotila Mata Temple](https://goo.gl/maps/K6XTwv5GS3eGUfCG7) but it's a climb of an hour.
* Chotila to Rajkot: 50 km
    * Got a new tyre
    * Rajkot city exploration
* Rajkot to Dwarka: 230 km

## Day 4
* Dwarkeshwar Temple/Mandir
    * It was a different experience to attend the `Kakad Aarti` at 0600 at the
      temple. Unlike Hindu temples here in Maharashtra, there was no oil,
      camphor and coconuts hence the temple was much clean.
* Bet Dwarka
    * 35 Km from Dwarka
    * Its on an island and ferry takes ~ 15/20 mins. Temple is not well
      maintained but the ferry ride was fun especially because of the accompanying flock
      of white seagulls.

## Day 5
* [Nageshvara Jyotirling](https://goo.gl/maps/QM4za1j5MHBiejxF6)
    * Just 21 km from Dwarka
    * Mahadev temple; one of the 12 jyotirling in India.
    * Pigeon holes outside the computer science theory are more lively.
* Rukmini Mandir <a href="/blog/assets/images/guj21/rukmini.jpg"><img src="/blog/assets/images/guj21/rukmini.jpg" width=250 /></a>
* Dwarka to Jungadh: 230 km

## Day 6
* Girnar Parvat
    * Its the highest peak of Gujarat.
    * Thanks to the new rope way; highest/longest in India we could skip the
      half the distance.
    * <a href="/blog/assets/images/guj21/ropeway.jpg"><img src="/blog/assets/images/guj21/ropeway.jpg" width=250 /></a>
    * There are further 5k+ steps to reach https://goo.gl/maps/95SnLSpKSaxiTo5m7
      roughly 2.5-3 hours climb & descent.
* The tomb of Mahabat Khan was closed for maintenance so we couldn't see it from inside.
* Junagadh to Somnath: 100 km

## Day 7
* Somnath Mandir
    * Its believed to be the first among the twelve Jyotirling in India.
    * The temple has long history of multiple reconstructions after each
      destruction by Muslim invaders. The current temple is reconstructed in
      1951.
    * `The Somnath temple signifies that the power of reconstruction is always
      greater than the power of destruction` -- Rajendra Prasad 1st president of
      India. [Ref](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somnath_temple)
    * Its one of the cleanest and well maintained Hindu temple I have ever visited to.
* There are 5/6 old small temples/places at Somnath which would take ~ 2 hours.
* Somnath to Gir/Sasan: 70 km

## Day 8
* Gir/Sasan national park
    * Because trip was not planned couldn't get Sasan Jungle Safari tickets as they
      were fully booked. Anyways in reality there is no designated area for tourist
      in national park. Devlia, instead, is a interpretation zone. Its 15 km from
      Sasan and has Lions, Leopards, Deers and Nilgai.
    * <a href="/blog/assets/images/guj21/devlia.jpg"><img src="/blog/assets/images/guj21/devlia.jpg" width=250 /></a>
* Gir to Junagadh: 76 km ~ 2hr
* Swaminarayn Mandir, Junagadh
* Gir to Ahmedabad: 336 km

## Day 9
* ISKCON Temple
* Science City
    * Spent half day here. Aquarium is the worth the visit and time.
* Akshardham
    * At Gandhinagar: 35km / ~1hr
    * Evening laser show is must see

## Day10
* Sabarmati Aashram
    * No time will be enough to go through museum, reading material or seeing
      Aashram's artifacts of Gandhi's era. Further more it has a Khadi and
      books & souvenir shop too.
* Bai Harir Vav
    * <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/55/Dada_Harir_Stepwell_Ahmedabad_Plan.jpg" width="500"/>
    * Its a huge; 5 story deep step well with two spiral staircases
* Ahmedabad to Anand: 80 km
    * The Kaira District Co-operative; who owns the brand Amul
    * Butter factory visit
* Anand to Baroda: 50 km

## Day11
* Laxmi Vilas Palace
    * The largest private dwelling built until that time.
    * 500 acre, Golf course, 120+ rooms and uncountable, precious & rare art
      collection from paintings to scriptures to glass works to weapons.
* Baroda to Statue of Unity (SoU): 100 km
    * World's tallest statue: 182 meter
    * Massive 2700 CR INR project funded by gvmt of Gujarat
* Sou to Ankleshwar: 90km ~ 2.5 hrs - Ghat

## Day12
* Ankleshwar to Surat: 70 km
* Sahara Darwaza
    * This was the last stop of the trip; a wholesale textile market. Surat is
      largest manufacturer of clothes.
    * Huge market with agents all over the roads looking for the customers.
      These agents have fix commissions per month from multiple shops. Unlike normal
      cloth shop where one can find different types of clothes with few variety,
      the markets have dedicated shops of specific types. Besides variety,
      prices are much less and it gives a clear idea on how much retailers would
      be making on each individual sale.
* Surat to Pune: 500 km
    * Reached home by 2200
