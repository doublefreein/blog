Yesterday's TMM was special to me—not because it gave me another PB or faster
time, but because I ran it barefoot. Recently, barefoot running has also come to
mean running with minimal gear, such as FiveFingers or huaraches. But here, it
was truly `bare` barefoot.

It took 4:47 to complete the FM distance, and to my surprise, there was
absolutely no pain in my feet. My legs and knees, however, had the usual post-FM
soreness.

The science behind barefoot running includes:
1. Barefoot running activates a range of motor nerves that switch on reflexive
   responses to optimize ankle, knee, and hip mechanics.
2. It improves running form by preventing heel-striking and promoting light,
   non-thumping strides.

The list of benefits is long:
1. Stronger feet
2. No more over-pronation
3. Fewer hip injuries
4. Reduced shin injuries
5. Rock-steady balance
6. Less foot pain after running
7. Grounding/Earthing benefits

I began my barefoot running journey by referring to blogs by
[Ken Bob](https://barefootrunning.com/). It was a very gradual process, starting with
2-3 km at a time. I’ve been running barefoot for 7-8 years for shorter distances
(under 21k), mostly on familiar routes. For distances beyond 21k, I previously
relied on minimal gear.

The best resources on barefoot running can be found on [Bretta Riches](https://runforefoot.com/running-barefoot/).

Back to Barefoot TMM: my long runs were primarily targeted for barefoot running.
I also incorporated some [barefoot exercises](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5xKokqeOb4). The Mumbai roads were
significantly better than the roads where I regularly practice my runs.
