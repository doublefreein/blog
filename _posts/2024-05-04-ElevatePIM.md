Following are some suggestions that we proposed in a brain storming session
conducted with one of the oldest Marathons of India.

1. XYZ Marathon has made tremendous contributions to making marathons popular
   across India, but such information is not readily available to current
   runners.  There is a need to promote this.

2. There are frequent marathons being organized everywhere in the country, but
   very few people know the right dos and don'ts while organizing them. Given
   XYZ Marathon's years of experience in organizing marathons, it can
   develop a standard protocol for managing such events, which can be followed
   by all organizers.

3. To spread awareness about running and related sports, there are many
   countrywide groups that are active. In order to promote XYZ Marathon and
   running, instead of targeting individual runners from different regions, we
   propose that XYZ Marathon can empower these running groups to spread
   awareness in their localities. This can be achieved by sharing training plans
   (diet and workout), teaching strength training methods, helping them organize
   local community runs, providing them with digital presence, and promoting the
   individual groups.

4. Every running event these days requires online registration, typically
   through profit-driven companies' platforms. Instead of this, if XYZ Marathon
   helps create one online platform where registration can be done and funds can
   be disbursed to respective organizers, it would streamline the process. This
   would require approving and endorsing the running groups who will also be the
   organizers. Another benefit of this is that a database of runners will be
   created, which can be reached for participation in the final event.

5. For better engagement and brand promotion, we suggest starting "Super Sunday"
   challenges. For example, those who participate and successfully complete four
   Super Sunday runs could receive an online certificate or even a discount
   (15/25%) in the final event of the same category. Both physical and virtual
   events can be targeted.

6. Instead of delegating final event responsibilities to individuals, it can be
   assigned to groups from the very early stages. This will help groups engage
   with XYZ Marathon organization very early on and develop a sense of
   ownership.

7. Running needs to be promoted in schools to encourage everyone to adopt
   running as a lifestyle. Introducing strength training and yoga in schools is
   one way to achieve this, and encouraging schools to organize marathons for
   students and parents could be another.

8. Pacers can be announced early, 16 to 12 weeks before the event, allowing each
   pacer to follow a training plan and also assist in promoting the event.

9. Social media promotion should be carried out throughout the year to increase
   brand awareness, done regularly but not aggressively. In addition to
   promoting the final event, promotion could focus on dos and don'ts in
   running, supporting other events hosted by various running groups, or even
   promoting the running groups themselves.

10. Creating a portal for all running groups to announce their activities and
    share information about them. This will also help new runners discover
    groups in their surroundings.

Core idea is to empower the local running groups to spread the awareness about
the runnings and promoting events than individual runners. Its a more a
federated, bottom-up, distributed model than the traditional, top-down,
centralized model.
