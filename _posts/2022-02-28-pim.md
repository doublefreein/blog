# Running a Marathon in huaraches

I ran the Pune International Marathon (PIM) yesterday. That was my 3rd Marathon.
Unlike previous ones, this one was a bit different

1. Had 8 weeks to prepare; earlier I had followed [a 16 weeks](https://yogeshpowar.github.io/blog/2021/08/01/FMTraining.html) training plan.
2. It was declared as a night marathon 3 weeks before

The preparation mostly went through the plan; except a week was lost in
Covid19's third wave. Long runs on the weekend and  interval, tempo runs and ST
& Yog sessions during the week.

I wanted to experiment two new ideas

1. Running in DIY Huaraches
2. Slow start

### Huaraches

[Huraches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huarache_(running_shoe)) are running
sandals for minimalists runners; a running gear for barefoot runners. I have
beenpracticing barefoot running for years now and the maximum that I have run
barefoot is 32 km; skin becomes sensitive after that especially on little rough
roads.  Huaraches would definitely help in such a situation.

I custom made a Huraches from a local cobbler. There are tons of videos on the
internet for the same. I would recommend
[this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zfJGoQvOaM).

This is how it looks.

I used it for a couple of 10ks and 5ks runs during the interval and  tempo runs.
But on the race day it didn't work as expected.

1. The knot below the sole was being constantly felt especially on the slope.
2. The lace used had a slight edge which bruised the toe near the big toe and was
   not bearable after 21km.

So after half the distance I had to hide the huaraches in the bush ;) and run
barefoot.

The design needs to be further tweaked to handle these issues.

### Slow start

In the last past marathons, the pace at the start of the marathon was much higher
than the planned race map and it happened because of the excitement of the
event. This [podcast]() helped me plan it.

This time the first 4 km were done almost 30-45 secs slower than the planned race
pace and matched the race pace eventually. This worked pretty well; could feel
enough energy at the end of 34 km and the last 8 km were done strong.

## The race day feedback

1. *Hydration Strategy* : Because the race was at the midnight; where the
   environment is much humid and warm than the usual mornings; hydration
   strategy played an important role.  It actually starts two days before the
   event. Almost 4-5 liters of water and lemon juice was consumed daily. During
   the run consumed ~200ml of water and juices for two km.

2. *Meals and sleep* : With midnight star time regular dinner was skipped and
   instead heavy breakfast and lunch was done and Millet's Khichadi at 7 PM. Also
   slept 3-4 hours during the day. Carried 3/4 salted dates in the pockets and
   were consumed apart from a banana and an orange during the run.

3. *Stops* : Had two stops in the first 21 km to adjust the huaraches. The first
   one to paste a medical tape at the bruising surface and the later to get
   rid of the gear. Between 25-34 km there were 5 secs walk per km; unplanned one
   but rough road patches and route ascent forced it. Last 8 km was mostly
   non-stop and much faster and better than previous marathons.

The race was completed in 4:49 hrs. Running barefoot in the second half
definitely helped with better cadence and pace.

Overall the experience was nice. Weather became calmer and cooler as the race
progressed and so was the traffic and public encouraging the runners ;).

Happy Running.
