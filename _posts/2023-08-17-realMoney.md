In my boarding school, Sainik School, we were provided with coupon money (paper
printed), which we could exchange at the school canteen for snacks and other
items.

The real currency or notes we received from our parents or from NCC were
deposited in the bank (SBI at that time).

To withdraw, on designated days after lunch, we would visit the bank, stand in
line with withdrawal slips and bank passbooks, and wait to obtain a metal token.

After a further wait, the teller would announce the token number, and only then
could we finally collect the actual currency. This currency was used for making
purchases during our book-outs, which typically occurred on certain Sundays.

While the process was lengthy and laborious, it instilled valuable lessons in us:

1. The art of completing withdrawal slips.
2. The skill of accurately counting physical currency.
3. How to responsibly manage and safeguard money.
4. The virtues of patience (waiting in queues) and strategic planning (since the
   bank operated on a fixed schedule, not every Sunday offered book-outs).

In today's digital age, it's uncertain if our children will experience these
aspects. The convenience of UPI and digital currencies may eliminate the need
for such lessons, for better or worse.

By the way, there is a concept known as `Financial Abstraction` which is well
explained in the TED video titled [When Money Isn't Real](https://youtu.be/_VB39Jo8mAQ) by Adam Carroll. It
refers to the idea that as money becomes increasingly abstract and less
tangible, it can alter our everyday interactions with it.

Encourage your children to handle physical money and gain early experiences with
it. This can contribute to a brighter future by laying the groundwork for
financial success. Providing them the opportunity to work with actual currency
helps develop a deeper understanding of its value and teaches essential
financial skills from an early age.
