The TMM is one of the very few commercial marathons that is well-managed. Its
timing makes it even better; the 3rd Sunday of Jan is almost the end of the
winter season, which also means the 16-week training spreads over the entire
cold/winter season.

I practice my runs with the [NCRunners Running Group](https://ncrunners.in)
group. The group has ~50+ active recreational runners who have completed either
FM/HM distance in well-known running events in India. This time, almost 20+
runners participated in FMs and 15+ participated in HMs for TMM.

We have custom-created training of 16 weeks for each runner in FM and HM. This
plan is based on the book [Runner's World Run Less, Run Faster](Runner's World Run Less, Run Faster).
The weekly training plan had 3 running activities and 2 strength training activities.

Due to some other personal commitments, I followed 2 running activities (Sunday
Long was mandatory), 1 strength training, and 1 cross-training day as cycling.

This was my 4th FM, and I planned for under 4:45 Hr.

# What Worked on the event day
1. Slow start: The first two kilometers were run a minute slow.
2. Tried to run under the target pace of 06:35 Mins/Km; slowing down at
   beginning & mid distance was key focus. BTW [here is the code](https://github.com/yogeshpowar/MarathonPacing) I wrote,
   which derives this pace with a slow start, pre-decided water stops, and some
   buffer time.
3. Running barefoot with minimalist gear ([Aquashoes](https://www.decathlon.in/p/8330684/sports-shoes/adult-aquashoes-100-grey?id=8330684&type=p))
   because the route had some under construction road patches with metal road
   joints with welding humps.
4. Non-stop running instead of taking 10 secs of hydration breaks every 3 km.
   Water, Salted Khajur, and electrolyte were consumed while running.
5. Having a constant cadence of 180 bpm; thanks to [Chubby Click](https://f-droid.org/packages/agrigolo.chubbyclick/) Free (free as in
   freedom) version of Metrone available on FDroid. Many strange runners ran
   with me getting hooked with these beats.

# What Didn't work on the event day
1. The planned pace was not maintained most of the 35KM and ended up consuming
   all the buffer time.
2. Last half km was a hard sprint at the end to catch the time.

**Completed the marathon in 4:43:43 as my new PB without any injury during the run.**

## Key feedbacks

1. Practice in a group and attending the event as a group has a different
   experience; difficult to put it in words and the only way to feel it is by
   attending one ;)
2. TMM Expo is really a waste of time and off-track for FM junta especially for
   those who are staying near CST. Commute to/from the expo is excess exertion.
3. Training runs were mostly done in NC route which is more flat; Hill-Repeat
   must be added even in the beginners training plan.
4. Training peaks of 25km, 30km, and 32km should be extended to 28km, 34km, and 37km
   respectively.
