# A quick trip to Chennai

Last week, I traveled to Chennai for a brief business trip. Fortunately, due to
my early arrival and a late departure on the following day, I had the
opportunity to enjoy three hours of free time each day.

## Day 1 from 0830 - 1130

### 0830-0900: Metro Airport - LIC
- I took the metro from the airport and headed towards the LIC terminal.
- The metro was not crowded, and everyone had a place to sit, which was unlike
  the usual experience for people from Mumbai or Pune.
- The ticket price for the metro ride was just 40 Rs.

### 0915-0945 Bus LIC - Kapaleshwar
- Took bus from LIC to Pataleshwar temple
- Ticket was 15 Rs

### 1000-1045: [Kapaleshwar Temple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kapaleeshwarar_Temple)

- The temple, built around the 7th century CE, is a remarkable example of
  Dravidian architecture.
- Despite the diverse languages and religious practices of the visitors, there
  was a sense of similarity and unity, thanks to the [Nataraj Temple, Satara](https://www.kamakoti.org/kamakoti/details/Uttara%20Chidambaram.html)
  in Satara; which was constructed based on the model of the main Chidambara temple
  in TamilNadu.

### 1045-1115: Ratna Cafe

- Accidently discovered this cafe which is very near to the temple. Its a 75
  years old cafe.
- Had Idli, Vada and Coffee; banana leaf and cocunut chuteny made it special
- Also did some shopping of soveneirs; coffee and coffee steel glass and wati.

## Day 2 from 0530 - 0830

### 0530-0600: Lighthouse

- It has total 10 floor and visitors are taken to lift on 9 th floor.
- entry fee is of 20 Rs only.
- 10th floor has huge rotating radar which can be seen once you visit the
  beach.

### 0600-0700: Marina Beach

- Its 2nd longest beach in the world covering distance of around 6 km.
- Also average width of 300m is longest I have seen.
- Dont forget to drink the Goti Soda

### 0700-0730: [Vivekanand Bhavan](https://vivekanandahouse.org/)

- This is a must-visit place for everyone. The experience one gets here is on
  another level.
- Swami Vivekananda stayed here for nine days after his triumphant return from
  the West.
- It has a technological museum that provides a glimpse into Swami Vivekananda's
  life and his message using the latest trends such as Virtual and Augmented
  Reality, modern 3D/4D effects.
- The meditation room on the 2nd floor offers an indescribable experience.
- The entry fee is 50 Rs.


### 0730-0830: Auto-Riksha, Metro to Airport
- Took metro from Government-Estate (nearest to Vivekanand Bhavan) to the
  airport; ticket was just 40 Rs.
- Had dinner at the exit of the Airport Metro station. There weren't many options
 available, but I ended up getting a plate of vegetarian fried rice for 80 Rs,
 which was twice the amount of rice I usually get in Pune. To avoid wasting
 food, I had to convince a stranger to share half of it with me.

In all, the trip was quick but thoroughly enjoyable. Especially the
auto-rickshaws in Chennai don't work on meters, and bargaining with them is a
whole new experience. By the way, Chennai has a 58% tax on alcohol, so it
doesn't seem like an ideal place for alcohol enthusiasts.
