Software engineering is not a solo sport. Its not about writing clever, complex
code that only original developer can understand. True engineering is about
writing clear, maintainable code that invites *collaboration*. Code that's
accessible enough for everyone on the team to contribute - from the newest
intern to the most experienced architect.

Yet in many teams, we hear juniors say, "I did this because the manager wrote
it," or "I didn't question it because it came from a senior."

On the other side, some seniors dismiss valuable input from their team,
ignoring suggestions without discussion. These are not just missed
opportunities but they are symptoms of **ego**.

But let's be honest: being open isn’t easy.  
It takes *courage* to suggest an idea to your senior.  
It takes *maturity* to accept feedback from a junior.

It also takes experience to know that theory and practice will always have a
gap; but the goal is to minimize it *together*. That happens only when the
team debates ideas, not individuals. Where code is seen as collective output,
not personal territory.

No matter how skilled you are, your code should stand on its own merit and not
on your title.

Let's talk about Agile. It's often misused as a cover for cutting corners. But
Agile doesn't mean rushing. It means focusing. It's not about doing many things
quickly and poorly but it’s about doing a few important things deliberately and
correctly.

Even your are the only developer in a project or a company, its better to assume
that the code will be future enhanced and maintained by a team.

Ego is the silent bug in many code bases.  
It doesn’t show up in logs or stack traces - but it silently slows teams down,
creates silos, and prevents progress.  

When you rise above the self, you see the system.

Happy Coding
