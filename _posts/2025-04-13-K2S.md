It’s been a while since I wanted to do this trek. It’s a night trek,
starting from Katraj and ending at Sinhagad Fort. It’s very well
known among trekking enthusiasts, especially people around Pune.

On 12th April, Saturday, 2025, I successfully completed the trek along
with 50 other trekkers from [NCRunners](https://ncrunners.in). It was
also the full moon night – Purnima & Hanuman Jayanti.

We started our trek by 20:30 and finished by 04:30; moving time was
around 4+ hours.

### Key Points

1. The trek is not easy and requires both physical and mental preparation to complete it without injuring oneself.  
2. Although many people do this trek, it doesn’t mean it’s safe. In fact, there’s no connectivity with Pune once you’re on the trail. I wish we had some medical support points created through volunteering, with the help of the government. These could be available only on special days/nights—say 2–3 times a year.  
3. Sports shoes are a strict no-go for this trek; trekking shoes with good grip are essential. Supporting stick are also helpful.
4. There’s no water source along the way, so carrying 3–4 litres of water is a must.  
5. It’s tough to rely only on moonlight for this trek; carrying a torch is a must, especially where there are steep descents.  
6. The group plays an important role; it’s also a great opportunity to get to know your friends better.  

### Experience

1. Thanks to the area reserved by the Forest Department, we don’t see any buildings here. It’s safely away from human greed that seeks to convert every piece of land into concrete. This trek takes you away from city life and into nature - so close to the city, yet so different.  
2. Walking in the dark (sometimes alone) is a calming experience - reminding you that you are also part of nature, and not separate from it.  
3. The night wind was cool, even though the temperature recorded in Pune city a few days earlier was 42.7°C.  
4. There is obviously no pitch-black phase in the trek because of light pollution from villages and highways. However, as you move closer to Sinhagad, the lights get fewer and fewer.  

Everyone from Pune should aim to do this trek with proper training & correct guidance.

Total distance coverted was around 12km & 6 hours with lot of breaks; enjoyed every step of it.
