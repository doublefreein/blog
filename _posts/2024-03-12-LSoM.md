Theme for [March's LSoM 2024](https://lsom.in) is Runners safety.

Following are the key points to consider to understand whats safe running.

1. Chase your goal gradually; consistency is the key. Practice delayed gratification. Say no to too fast too soon.
2. Engage all your senses. Avoid multitasking while running. Headphones/calls can ignore early sound cues. Obey traffic rules.
3. Be visible in the surroundings. Explore reflectors, lights, and bright clothing.
4. Listen to your body; stay hydrated, identify discomfort, pain, and rest.
5. Running is best experienced with your run buddy.
6. Learn life saving skills like CPR and first aid.
