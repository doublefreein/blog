Today I completed the NCRunners 100-Day Challenge in exactly 100 days.

This was my second 100-Day Challenge; the first was about the [100-Day Running Challenge](https://yogeshpowar.github.io/blog/2023/09/15/100daysOfRunnig.html).

This time, to encourage more people to participate, more types of activities were included. It was more of a group activity than an individual one, as many started the challenge around the same time.  
Here is the challenge [page](https://www.ncrunners.in/ncrhdc).

### Key takeaways

1. Multi-activity options made it more practical.  
2. Public commitment and daily updates created healthy pressure to stay consistent.  
3. It was even more fun when done as a group activity.  

The distribution of activities over the last 100 days is as follows:

It's a great challenge to help build a healthy lifestyle.I urge more and more people to join the club.
