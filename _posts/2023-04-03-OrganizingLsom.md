LSoMs are runs organized on the last Sunday of every month. Different running
groups take responsibilities to organize the event. Last month's LSoM, March
26th, 2023, was organized by Nanded City Runners and Vishwa Runners.

LSoMs are community runs with the only purpose of spreading awareness about
running in the neighborhood. Unlike other commercial running/marathon events,
they are organized by volunteers who are runners first. Because of this, there
is no commercial angle to the run, hence no hefty sponsors, no profit-driven
agenda, and no paid marketing. That's the reason why LSoMs are organized with
just 150 Rs of registration fees in an era where well-known running events
charge anywhere from 1000 to 3000 Rs.

The following are the main features of the LSoM Community Running Event held on
March 26th at Nanded City, Pune:

1. The event was organized by 150+ spirited volunteers who are runners first.
2. 1800+ participants, ranging from a 15-month-old child with their parents to a
   76-year-young man.
3. 60 senior citizens were sponsored and enjoyed the fun run.
4. 25 ZP school children were sponsored to participate in the event.
5. Many volunteers sponsored their maids to participate in the LSoM.
6. The main theme of the event was "Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle." Plastic was not
   used throughout the event. Steel plates, spoons, and glasses were used for
   drinking water and juice, which significantly reduced plastic usage. The
   entire event venue and route were plastic-free.
7. Handmade cloth carry bags were distributed to every runner & volunteer to
   support local craftsmen and the environment.
8. An eye donation awareness campaign was run, with distribution of forms and
   pamphlets at the venue.
9. A specialized team of physiotherapists and doctors were involved to support
   the runners.
10. A Dhol and Tasha Pathak were involved to boost the morale of the runners.
 
The event was well received and appreciated by all, and many veteran runners
have even conveyed to us that it was **the best LSoM ever**.

#### To plan an event like this, in my opinion, one needs the following:

1. An active running group who runs together, strength trains together,
   participates/trains in other running/triathlon events together, and stays
   together. Just creating a Whatsapp running group is not sufficient. The life
   of any group is extended by regularly adding newcomers to the group.
   Organizing a small similar event with smaller capacity of LSoM is recommended
   before actually applying for it. This is where volunteers with high josh come
   from. Would be roughly busy last 2 days of the event.
2. At least 10 group members who can lead and take ownership of specific tasks.
   These are people who will be planning and executing their specific tasks.
   They are the subset of volunteers who are willing to spend extra effort and
   time for the event and will be in charge of assigned tasks. Called incharge
   and would be roughly busy for around 3 weeks.
3. At least 2 individuals who can take the event as the first priority from
   their day-to-day tasks. These persons will have an overall picture imprinted
   in their mind; must have performed the incharge role in previous LSoMs and
   volunteered at many other runs. Would be roughly busy for 2 months.

#### Specific to Nanded City LSoM:

1. The NCRunners group was active thanks to a 16-week training planning done for
   events like TMM and Bergman.
2. Many members from the group were either volunteers or incharges in the last
   LSoM organized in 2019 and were aware of the challenges. Besides, we
   organized a 5th-year celebration event to engage and activate the group from
   the organizing side.

#### Challenges faced and open

1. NCRunners is not a legal entity, so we couldn't collect registration money
   ourselves. We had to find an NGO to handle the money and accounting, which
   took time. If LSoM had a legal entity or collaborated with one, we could have
   avoided this search.
2. It was difficult to get permission from NC-PMS because the event was not limited
   to NC residents. Renting a venue also had an impact on the budget.
3. Finding sponsors for breakfast, volunteer T-shirts, and post-event dinner was
   a challenge. We had to make sure that no single sponsor dominated the event.
4. Online booking has high transaction costs, with Townscript charging almost
   15%. With UPI prevalent, we need a cheaper alternative for low-ticket events.
5. It's becoming harder to get people to register for the event because we're
   competing with OTT platforms, social media apps, and online gaming apps. Many
   big institutes with deep pockets are also announcing running events with high
   marketing budgets which get more attention than event like LSoM.

Finally, Events like this tests the strength & stamina of the group which runs
tirelessly just to keep the joy of running flowing.
