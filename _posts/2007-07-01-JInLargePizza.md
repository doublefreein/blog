# J in a large Pizza

This story is about a graph G of four points; J, H, Y, and A.

One day all the points of graph G got fed up with the kind of food they get in
their mess; it was a complete mess. So they decided to order some Domino's
pizzas. Like every year Domino's had their anniversary offer; One on One. Of
course some conditions were applied like the offer was available only on large
and medium size pizzas.

Generally bill is shared equally among those four points but as point J was very
happy about his performance in the graph and graph theory, he wanted to
celebrate it by paying the entire bill. H and J's idea of having only two large
pizzas (One non-veg + 1 free large veg as J is a vegetarian point) was strongly
rejected by points A and y; Reason? They were worried about their share of
non-veg pizza. So the final order was 2 large and 2 medium i.e., 2 paid and 2
free. Obviously they considered Ceil function while rounding the order because
their hunger was given higher precedence over wastage of Veg Pizza since the
only point interested in eating it was J. So H,A and y were a bit worried.

They realized their worry was futile when they saw J who has already finished
the one large veg Pizza of 14 inch in diameter with Extravaganza and has started
gazing at Non-Veg Pizzas.  Above all, that day apart from his lunch J had had
enough of evening snacks in the mess.

Thank you god for making J a vegetarian.
