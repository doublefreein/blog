The houses built with mud/soil & lime are
a) Eco friendly
    i. Unlike Cement, it has very low carbon footprint
    ii. Not an product of factory
    ii. Transportation emission cost
b) Energy efficient
    i. Mud walls have high thermal mass, cooler in summer & warmer in winter
    ii. Breathable: Lime allows walls to breath, preventing moisture buildup and
    improving indoor air quality.
    iii. Lower Energy Bills
c) Cost Effectiveness
    i. Cement & steel are costlier
    ii. Properly built mud-lime structures require little maintenance and last
    for generations.
d) Aesthetic & Cultural Value
    i. Such buildings have a timeless, earthy look that blends with nature.

Here are some beautiful structures build using soil & lime.

## Construction Techniques

A. Traditional Mud Construction
- *Cob Construction*: A mix of clay, sand, straw, and water is molded by hand and
  built up in layers. This method creates strong, sculptural walls.

- *Rammed Earth*: Layers of damp soil are compacted within a temporary frame,
  creating solid and durable walls.

- *Adobe Bricks*: Sun-dried mud bricks are stacked with a mud-lime mortar,
  providing stability and breathability.

- *Wattle and Daub*: A woven lattice of wooden strips is coated with a mud-lime
  mixture, offering flexibility and earthquake resistance.

B. Lime Integration for Durability
- *Lime Stabilization*: Lime is mixed with soil to improve strength, water
  resistance, and longevity.
- *Lime Plaster & Wash*: Applied to walls for weather protection, pest resistance,
  and a breathable finish.
- *Limecrete Flooring*: An alternative to cement floors, providing insulation and
  moisture control.

#### Case Studies From India
1. *Hunnarshala Foundation, India*
- This organization has revived traditional mud and lime techniques,
  successfully building homes in earthquake-prone regions like Kutch, Gujarat.
- They use stabilized adobe and rammed earth for long-lasting, low-cost homes.

2. *Auroville Earth Institute, Tamil Nadu, India*
- Focuses on sustainable building using compressed stabilized earth blocks
  (CSEB) with lime.
- Their projects demonstrate how modern aesthetics and traditional techniques
  can blend seamlessly.
