The **Nanded City (NC) Last Sunday of Month (LSoM)** run was organized on
**Sunday, March 31st, 2024**, at the Nanded City premises. The Holding area was
the Amphitheater, and distance categories of 3km, 5km, 10km, and 15km were
routed all inside the Nanded City.

The event was organized by **NCRunners** with the help of 175+ volunteers from
*NCRunners*, *Vishwa Runners*, and *PR South* running groups.
Although the event was held on a particular day, a series of community
activities were carried out to reach new runners and participants.

1. The central theme of the event was Runner’s Safety, and to support it, we
   arranged four **Cardio-Pulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) hands-on sessions** for
   120+ runners. The sessions were executed and sponsored by *Bharati Hospital*
   with the help of *Dr. Archana Singhavi* of *Rotary Club of Pune Synergy*.
   Different methods of runner’s safety measures were promoted during the
   regular running sessions and also digitally.
2. We encouraged members of two new societies from Nanded City, Kalashree and
   Bageshree, to pursue running as a lifestyle and be part of NCRunners.
   Multiple **running and strength training sessions** were conducted for new
   runners/members.
3. We reached a couple of Zilla Parishad Schools and **donated 40+ bibs** to
   encourage running for the kids.

**1500+ participants** of all age groups were part of the event, which came from
different places in Pune, but the majority of the participants were from Nanded
City, inline with the goal of LSoM to spread awareness about running in the
local community.

On the event day, the following key activities were organized:
1. We hosted **a blind run** where people ran in pairs, but one of the
   participants was blindfolded. Upon completion, we awarded the participants of
   the blind run with NIO badges. *National Institute of Opthalmology* (*NIO*)
   was a lead sponsor who helped us by sponsoring the breakfast for the runners.
2. **Handmade cloth carry bags** were distributed to every runner & volunteer to
   support local craftsmen and the environment. These bags were sponsored by the
   *Rotary Club of Pune Synergy*.
3. A specialized team of **physiotherapists** and doctors were involved to
   support the runners, courtesy of Dr. Pallavi Wakode, HOD & Associate
   Professor at community & physiotherapist department of Navale Hospital.

Different other local organizations and individuals came forward to support this
community run.

1. *Bansal classes*, Nanded, sponsored the bibs & badge printing, partial route
   hydration and also gifted a pen to the participants.
2. *Zepto*, online grocery store, sponsored partial on route hydration and post
   run energy bar.
3. *AquaRise Unecha Group*, Nanded sponsored water for the runners.
4. *Geeta watches*, Dhayari sponsored t-shirts for volunteers.
5. *Shri Prashant Ugale*, real estate developer, sponsored the partial route hydration.
6. *Shri Narsinh Lagad*, Nanded, provided space, water & electricity for preparing
   the breakfast.

We thank all volunteers, participants, and sponsors for making this event a
grand success. We believe events like this bind the running community together
and grow.
