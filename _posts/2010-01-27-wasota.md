# Wasota (Satara) Jungle/Fort Trek

* 24 Jan 10
    * 12.00 PM: Started From _Pune_ after the dinner at "_Sayali_" Near
        _Sinhagd Road_. Chicken Curry is awesome there. This time we didn't take
        with us our Bullets. We were in a Car.
    * 12:45 PM: Tea @ _Khabatki Ghat_.
    * 01:15 PM: Reached _Satara_ Home.
* 25 Jan 10
    * 10:00 AM: Started from _Satara_.
    * 12:00 PM: Reached _Bamanoli_ via _Kaas lake_. Paid 1600 RS for two
      launches (800 RS each). One to drop us near the _Wasota Jungle_ (1 - 1.5
      hr Journey) and other to collect us from there. Also paid RS 175 for the
      forest department fee. We were supposed to stay on the fort but forest
      department doesn't allow that.
    * 01:00 PM: Reached _Wasota Jungle_. (See Picture) and Started our Trek.

    * 02:30 PM: Reached _Wasota Fort_. Some part of trek is difficult. Total one
      way trek was 5-6 KM from where the launch dropped us. 80% from the trek is
      through the dense Jungle. Happened to see few wild hens and lots of
      strange birds which we had not seen before. On the fort, there is a well
      which came for our rescue to quench our thirst.
    * 03:45 PM: Started to descent. The difficult part became more difficult
      because there was no good grip for the shoes.
    * 05:05 PM: Reached the _Koyana back water_ from where second launch
      collected us to drop at _Bomnoli_; the start position.
    * 7:00 PM: Reached _Bamnoli_.
    * 9:00 PM: Reached _Satara_. Had dinner at "_Manas_"; non-veg was the best.
    * 1:00 AM: Reached _Pune_.
