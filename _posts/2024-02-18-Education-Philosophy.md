## Swami Vivekanand on Education

<quote>Bring all  light into the world; light, bring light! Let light come upto
everyone; the task will not be finished till everyone has reached the Lord.
Bring light to the poor, and bring more light to the rich, for they require more
than the poor; bring light to the ignorant  and more light to the educated for
the vanities of the eduction of our time are tremendous!

Thus bring light to all and leave the rest unto the Lord.

Education is not the amount of information that is put into your brain and run
riot there, undigested, all your life. We must have life-building, man-making,
character-making, assimilation of ideas

## Sri Aurobindo on Education

<quote>
The chief aim of the education should be to help the growing souls to draw out
that in itself which is best and make it perfect for a noble cause.
</quote>

Principles of true teaching ([^sri])

1. `Nothing can be taught`: The teacher has to play the role of a helper
and guide not as an instructor or task-master
1. `Not to Force the Soul`: The mind has to be consulted in its own growth.. To
   force the nature to abandon its own DHARMA is to do it permanent harm,
   mutilate its growth and deface its perfection. It is a selfish tyranny over a
   human soul and a wound to the nation.
2. `Teaching from near to far`: To work from the near to the far, from that
   which is to that which shall be. The education should start from the known to
   unknown.
