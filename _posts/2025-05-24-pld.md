Following are the best practices that I learned by doing. Every point added here was offered as solution to some scalability & maintainable problem in the past for the tech product/s we were serving.

### Core Design & Stability

1. Build core logic on the **abstraction layer** rather than directly on third-party API responses. This ensures *modularity* and easier change management.

2. Implement **state-machine** (SM) at the core logic. A system could have multiple SMs. This ensures deterministic control over *lifecycle flows*.

3. Think of **locking** where there is race or critical-region. This prevents concurrency bugs and maintains *data integrity*.

4. There should be a **separate DB** layer with a common entry & exit gate for future extensions. This isolates persistence logic and eases changes like DB migration or sharding.

5. Avoid cron jobs, scripts, or parallel systems consuming the same database or **repeating business logic**. Direct DB access should be avoided. This eliminates risk of *logic duplication* or unsynchronized operations.

6. **Versioning** must be implemented for APIs, events and internal modules. This enables *backward compatibility* and smoother rollouts of breaking changes.

### Maintainability & Extensibility

7. There must be **common gates** (entry/exit) for API handlers.  This centralizes authentication, validation, and logging.

8. Common utility/modules/libraries should be reused via a shared codebase. Avoid re-writing. Promotes **Don't Repeat Yourself** (DRY) principles and consistent behavior.

9. Maintain **event queues** for other services to collect or consume. This decouples services and supports async communication.

10. **Unit testing** should be mandatory for all core modules and components. This builds confidence during refactors and CI/CD pipelines.

11. **Monitoring** should be integrated at the service level for metrics, errors, and performance. This enables observability, alerting, and system health tracking.

### Operational Enhancements

12. **Logging levels** should be centrally managed, with options to enable logs for specific modules or sub-modules. This helps in targeted debugging without bloating logs.

13. **Documentation is a must**; it extends the life of the code. This Aids onboarding and transitions; especially useful post-MVP phase.


While time constraints in v1 or first drop may lead us to skip some, we must eventually address them. These principles are critical for building a stable and scalable product.

Happy Coding.
