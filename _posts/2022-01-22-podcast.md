# Podcasts

Podcasts are episodic series  of digital audio files that users can download on
their device for listening.

I use the [AntennaPod](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/de.danoeh.antennapod/)
app from [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/de.danoeh.antennapod/)
to receive them on my Android device.

Apart from the actual contents of the podcast & Internet, what's the single best
thing that makes users follow their favorite podcasts is *RSS*.

* **RSS** is RDF Site Summary
* **RDF** is Resource Description Framework from W3C which shares the data models of
metadata
* **W3C** is World Wide Web Consortium is the main international standards organization for WWW
* **WWW** is the World wide Web and <u>is not</u> synonymous with the Internet. Its an
information system where URLs work over the Internet.
* **URL** is Uniform Resource Locator (URL) a.k.a *the web address*

So it's RSS([^rss]) which brings the latest updates to user's devices. Its the bell
icon of the good old Internet without annoyed [surveillance
capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance_capitalism) from the
big techs.

Back to the podcasts, it's an another universe which is way different than videos
or websites which seek our constant attention. One can play their favorite
podcast and still do their work. Eg., drive a car, code or make dishes.

Three podcasts that I would recommend for guys like me are

1. Dan Carlin's Hardcore History : Its no doubt world's greatest podcast. I
   discovered this from another podcast which is next on the list.

2. Lex Fridman Podcast :  which covers conversation about science, technology,
   history, philosophy and beyond. All popular/unpopular real life heros have
   been on this podcast. [RSS](https://lexfridman.com/feed/podcast/)
3. Freakonomics Radio by Stephen J Dubner : Weekly podcast with the big shots
   from economics to sleep. [RSS](https://feeds.simplecast.com/Y8lFbOT4)

[^rss]: RSS's Wikipedia [page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) mentions [Ramanathan V. Guha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramanathan_V._Guha) for contributing to the basic idea of RSS as early as 1995. Surprised to see that he has done his schooling from Pune; place where I now reside. Today's free Internet stands on the shoulders of guys like him.
