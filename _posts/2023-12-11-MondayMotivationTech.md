Work is more than a trade of time for approval. It's an opportunity for personal
growth, creativity, and contributing value. While satisfying your superiors is
important, it's equally crucial to find fulfillment in what you do. Aim to
create meaningful contributions, learn, and grow in your role. Your satisfaction
and passion will naturally reflect in the quality of your work, benefiting both
you and the company.

1. [ ] Implement modular coding practices to enhance maintainability, reusability,
       and scalability of code components.
2. [ ] Develop products with agility; practice agile development to adapt to
       changing requirements.
3. [ ] Purchase one unit of the instrument we are selling; this way, you **become
       a user of our platform** and can notice user issues.
4. [ ] Embrace diverse perspectives, especially from different teams; isolating
       teams hinder collaboration.
5. [ ] Ensure quality in delivery, achievable only through **programmatically
       testing**: unit tests (for developers) and automated testing (for QA).
6. [ ] Maintain transparency in communication: documentations, meeting minutes,
       and reasoning behind decisions or feature assumptions must be accessible
       to the team.
7. [ ] Design ethically, prioritizing user privacy and data security, while
       ensuring scalability with minimal infrastructure costs.
