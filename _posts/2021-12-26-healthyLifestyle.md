Next year at the doorstep and following a single table summarizes learnings of
this year. Its gradual step by step upgrade to a better lifestyle which has
worked well for me and many like me.

This will not only help someone to get in shape but will also boost self
confidence.

The plan is created with my personal experience in running([^running]), strength
training([^st]), fasting([^fasting]) and different diet suggestions by Dr
Khadar([^millets]), Dr Jamnadas([^jamnadas]) and Dr Maya Adam([^food101])

Best way to execute this plan is to follow this in a group or at least with one of
your buddies. Another hack is to commit a penalty per day for not following the
plan and pay it to your friend or donate.

Happy New Year.
