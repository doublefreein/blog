Wanted to give long-distance running (beyond 42 km) a try, and the Tata Ultra Marathon (TUM), Lonavala, was an ideal candidate for the same. Multiple reasons:

1. TUM is synced with the Tata Mumbai Marathon (TMM); that is, if you have prepared for and successfully completed TMM, then the efforts are manageable.
2. Lonavala is not far from Pune; the commute is convenient. For me, one of my close friends stays in Lonavala.

### Preparations
1. Post-TMM, I completed one Sinhagad 17 km run and a DSK hill repeat run.
2. Targeted pace was 1 min slower than TMM.
3. Hydration strategy was changed; planned to consume 1 khajur (date) & 1/2 banana and 200 ml of water with Enerzal every 4 km (30 mins).
4. [TMM](https://yogeshpowar.github.io/blog/2025/01/20/BarefootFM.html) was run real barefoot (without minimal gear), but since the TUM road conditions were not good, I decided to run in minimal gear (Aqua shoes from Decathlon).

### Pre-Run Events
* 10:00 - Early lunch
* 11:30 - Started from Pune by car
* 14:00 - Arrived at the venue to collect the Bib
* 15:00 - Reached Abhya's place
* 16:00 - Early dinner
* 16:30 - Slept
* 22:00 - Pre-run nutrition - 4 slices of bread with peanut butter & jam
* 00:00 - Power nap
* 00:45 - Started for the venue
* 00:59 - Reached the venue
* 01:03 - Crossed the start line

### During Run Events
1. The race was flagged off at 01:00; we assumed it was at 01:15 and reached the start line 3 minutes late.
2. The initial major ascent of 8 km was managed with a 10-second walk and 10-second run strategy.
3. Consuming a khajur & 1/2 banana every 4 km didn’t last beyond 16 km. The frequency had to be changed.
4. Drinking 200 ml of water/glucose drink at every water station was consistently followed.
5. After the halfway mark, all ascents were walked.
6. Post 30 km, resuming running after stopping became difficult, so I avoided dead stops—either walked or ran.
7. Post 35 km, I felt dullness and a lack of energy, so I consumed electrolyte powder that I carried. The glucose drink provided didn’t have enough electrolytes or salts.
8. Mentally, I mapped the 42 km distance to a full marathon (FM), the longest I had run before. So, I first targeted 42 km and then focused on the remaining 8 km.
9. The downhill section after FM was not easy either; more impact on knees & ankles forced me to slow down.
10. Completed the 50K (50.95 km as per my Garmin) in 6 hours and 52 minutes.

### Post-Run Activities
* 07:56 - Crossed the finish line
* 08:15 - Got some stretching done from the physio
* 08:35 - Had breakfast (though consuming so much glucose, khajur & banana made me not feel hungry)
* 08:45 - Called Abhya to pick us up (no more walking :))
    * <a href="/blog/assets/images/TUM.jpeg"> <img src="/blog/assets/images/TUM.jpeg" height="250">

### Thanks

50.95 km is my personal record for the longest run, and I am glad I completed it without any injury. As always, let me give credit where it’s due.

1. A ton of thanks to Abhya (Abhijit Garud); I cannot imagine this accomplishment without his support. Terrific pampering he has done for us. Abhya, thanks, Bhava.
2. Thanks to Namrata & Rujula for letting me do this and tolerating me.
3. To my run buddy, Prafulla—neither the training was boring nor the final run; glad you came back in the final stretch after I lost you for 5 km post-31 km.
4. Finally, friends from NCRunners, who keep doing such crazy things and supporting each other.
