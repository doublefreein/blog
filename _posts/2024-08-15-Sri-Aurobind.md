We were fortunate to attend and complete the [Yoga Instructor’s
Course](https://svyasa.edu.in/yoga-instructor-course/) from
[S-Vyasa](https://svyasa.edu.in), a deemed university. It was an offline course
that lasted from February 2024 to August 2024. More than 50 lectures were
conducted, and in Pune, it was managed by [Chiranjiv
Foundation](https://www.yicpune.com/index.php). My wife and I both enrolled in
the weekend batches; classes were held from 7:30 to 9:30 AM near Tilak Road on
Saturdays and Sundays.

The syllabus was equally divided between theory and practicals. The theory
covered four major streams of yoga (Karma, Bhakti, Jnan, and Rajyoga) with
references from the Gita. It also introduced the Vedas, Upanishads, and Indian
culture and history. The practical sessions included Surya Namaskars, various
asanas, kriyas, pranayama, and cyclic meditation.

I strongly recommend this course to anyone interested in Indology and keen to
explore life the Indian way in a serious manner, as it includes assignments,
practical and theory exams, and reports.

My report was on the topic "Introduction to Integral Yoga of Sri Aurobindo."
Please download the report in
[PDF](https://yogeshpowar.github.io/blog/assets/IntegralYoga.pdf) or
[ODP](https://yogeshpowar.github.io/blog/assets/IntegralYoga.odp) format from
here. Its also called as `Yoga of Perfection`.


"As always, the more we study, the more we realize how much we don't know. And
in that realization, we stay grounded."

It is the 15th of August today, and it is Sri Aurobindo's birthday. I am sharing
a small essay on him, which I compiled from the The book, [The Synthesis
of Yoga](https://archive.org/details/the-synthesis-of-yoga-sri-aurobindo), by Sri
Aurobindo and his [Wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Aurobindo) and .
It is compiled with the intention of introducing Sri Aurobindo and his
contribution to the Indian Independence movement for a 3-5 minute speech.

An Introduction

## Early Life in London

Sri Aurobindo was born in Kolkata on 15th August 1872. Krishna Dhun Ghose, his
father, wanted his sons to enter the Indian Civil Service (ICS), an elite
organization comprising around 1,000 people. To achieve this, it was necessary
for them to study in England, so the entire family moved there in 1879. He
studied at St. Paul's School in London and at King's College, Cambridge.

He learned Greek and spent his years reading literature and English poetry while
also acquiring some familiarity with German and Italian.

He passed the written ICS examination after a few months, ranking 11th out of
250 competitors. Aurobindo had no interest in the ICS and purposefully arrived
late to the horse-riding practical exam to disqualify himself from the service.

## Baroda

Returning to India in 1893, he worked for the next 13 years in the princely
state of Baroda, serving the Maharaja as a professor at the state college.

During his stay in Baroda, he contributed many articles to *Indu Prakash* and
served as the chairman of the Baroda College Board. He began taking an active
interest in the Indian independence movement against British colonial rule,
although his position in the Baroda state administration prevented him from
engaging in overt political activities. Despite this, he worked behind the
scenes and connected with resistance groups in Bengal and Madhya Pradesh while
traveling to these states. Aurobindo also established contact with Lokmanya
Tilak and Sister Nivedita.

At Baroda, Aurobindo self-studied Sanskrit and Bengali.

## Calcutta

In 1906, Aurobindo resigned from his post in Baroda and moved to Calcutta, where
he became one of the leaders of the Indian nationalist movement. As editor of
the newspaper *Bande Mataram*, he advocated for complete independence from
Britain. He was arrested in May 1908 in connection with the Alipore Bomb Case
and was subsequently released after a year of isolated imprisonment.

## Pondicherry

Upon his release, he started two new publications: *Karmayogin* in English and
*Dharma* in Bengali. He also delivered the Uttarpara Speech, hinting at a shift
in his focus to spiritual matters. Repression from the British colonial
government continued due to his writings in these new journals, and in April
1910, Aurobindo moved to Pondicherry, where the British colonial secret police
monitored his activities.

Sri Aurobindo was nominated twice for the Nobel Prize—once in 1943 for
Literature and again in 1950 for Peace—but did not receive the award.

His well-known publications include:
a) The Life Divine
b) The Synthesis of Yoga
c) Essays on the Gita
d) Savitri

Sri Aurobindo passed away on 5th December 1950.

Sri Aurobindo's life and works continue to inspire generations, reminding us of
the profound connect between spirituality and pursuit of freedom, both personal
and collective.

"Inner transformation in shaping a world's destiny."
