# HM in Sub2

Before I begin, I bow down to all the running gods who complete FM in sub4 or
50km in 5hrs and dont make any fuss about it (like writing posts like this ;))

I am not one of them.

I prefer running barefoot for distances under 25km; most of my runs are in the
range of 10-15km; for longer distance feet become sensitive to rough road
patches. I have been running regularly for 6 years now and am more of a
recreational runner. Enjoy pace of 6-6:15 min/km.

But, I did run a HM (PRBM-18) in sub2 and it was a special one not because it
was my fastest but because it was more of an emotional one. During the run;
witnessed an accident between a car & truck and I tried to help the victim and
she was critically injured; thank god she was saved with rapid action by the volunteers
and doctors at the event but during the entire run I was unsure if she would make
it or not. I completed the run just under 2 hrs then; almost all the run I was
worried about her.

I was always of the opinion that sub2 happened because of that worry/fear and
maybe never again I might be able to do the same. Most 20+ runs after that run
were 6:15+ min/km.

Since last year (post 1st lock-down), I have changed my running form after reading the book
[Chi Running](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/391659.ChiRunning). I Was
targeting 5:35-45 min/km for regular 10km runs. Some key learnings from the theory and
my experience are

1. [Strength Training](2021/07/25/st.html) sessions are must for injury free running
2. Good Cadence (steps per min) matters most and should be 180+ for better runs.
3. Overstepping kills the momentum; prefer quick shorter steps.
3. Lifting legs from behind is much easier than lifting the knees

Technique for barefoot running is a lot different than with shoes. I can
recommend [Good Old Ken Bob's original site](https://barefootrunning.com/archives/category/technique) for beginners and
this video on [Principles of Natural Running with Dr. Mark Cucuzzella](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSIDRHUWlVo).
Must read and see; it has helped me a lot.

Anyways, today I attempted a sub2 in [NC](https://twitter.com/ncrunners_in). Average pace to complete 21.1 km in 2 hours is
5:43. With 1 min of buffer it comes down to 5:40 min/km.

For the 1st sub2; I slogged at the end to catch the time and it was tough; so
thought of saving the time first and consuming it later. BTW its also a good old
financial advice for all ;).

Strategy was simple: do 1st 11 km in 1 hour (5:27 min/km) and the remaining 10km in
59 mins (5:54 min/km).

Also because the 1st hour was fast; so no water breaks in the first hour and so consume
water every 2 km only in the later half. I typically carry a 650 ml water bottle. 10 sec
water breaks every 2 km in the last 10 km made it a 5:49 min/km target.

Ok that was the plan.

Execution followed the plan except 
- Run buddies were not in the plan and the run was a team activity.
- For the last 2/3 km no plan works.

Thanks to Ganesh (Sargam) for pacing the first 10 km and Vijay (Pancham) for the last
10 km; and the best part was they didn't know they had a major stake in the game.

Happy Running
