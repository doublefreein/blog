youtube video by Shri Avinash Dharmadhari on the same topic.

Following is the timeline created after prompting to GTP5 and its in sync with
the talk. Majorly its Britisher who are responsible for the partition and almost
a century worth of strategy they executed to do the same.

# Timeline of Partition Responsibility

### 1857–1905: Seeds of Division

* 1857 Revolt: British see joint Hindu-Muslim uprising as a threat.
* Afterward, divide-and-rule strategy begins.
* 1905: Partition of Bengal (East Bengal as Muslim-majority, West as Hindu-majority).

### 1906–1930: Institutionalizing Separate Identities

* 1906: Muslim League formed (with British encouragement).
* 1909: Morley–Minto reforms: Separate Muslim electorates.
* 1916: Lucknow Pact (Congress & League cooperation).
* 1920s: Rise of communal riots + Hindu Mahasabha vs Muslim League.
* 1930: Jinnah's "two-nation theory" starts gaining ground.

### 1930–1939: Political Rivalry Sharpens

* 1935: Government of India Act - provincial elections.
* 1937 elections: Congress wins big, Muslim League does poorly - Jinnah turns more separatist.
* Muslims feel alienated by Congress rule in provinces (seen as "Hindu raj").

### 1940–1945: Pakistan Demand Emerges

* 1940 Lahore Resolution: demand for separate Muslim homelands.
* 1942 Quit India Movement: Congress jailed, League strengthens ties with British.
* WWII: British rely on League - League gains legitimacy.

### 1946–1947: Collapse into Partition

* 1946 Cabinet Mission Plan: proposed united India with autonomy. Congress accepts, but Nehru's statement about strong center scares League. League withdraws.
* Direct Action Day (1946) - massive Calcutta killings.
* Punjab & Bengal riots follow.
* 1947 Mountbatten Plan: Partition announced, rushed in 5 months.
* Violence explodes - \~1 million dead, 14 million displaced.

# Big Picture (1857 - 1947)

1. British: Start the cycle, maintain it, then exit irresponsibly.
2. Muslim League: From minority protection - Pakistan demand.
3. Congress: Couldn't balance Hindu-Muslim trust.
4. Communal forces: Took political divisions to street violence.

All four are responsible but with different share.
