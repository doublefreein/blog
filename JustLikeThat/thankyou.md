Thank you all ([^wellWishers]) for your warm birthday wishes. They made my day
special.

Almost all the wishes came on chat and instead of replying to them with
*Thank you* or *Pranam/Namaste* (actually *high-fives*); I thought of doing
something different on this birthday.

I started counting the *Happy Birthday* wishes that I received over the call and
instant messages.

And donated `# wishes times a fixed amount` to a NGO working near my home town.
And the pleasure was immense.

Hope the wishes bring joy to many in need.

Thank You.
