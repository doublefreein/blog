Recently my father-in-law gave me a Marathi book titled [Ek Dishecha
Shodh](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17405081-eka-dishecha-shodh) by
[Sandeep Waslekar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundeep_Waslekar). Inspiring
and thought provoking book and I would recommend it to all who are seeking some
direction in life. No, I don't mean it for just civil servant aspirants only but
also for people in mid-life crisis or someone who is still thinking about what's
next.

The book, although refers national/international events before 2010, relatively
old in 2021, especially with national politics; it's a good showcase of an
individual who began his journey from a typical suburban town local school to
a college in Mumbai to Oxford university.

Two key events that shaped his educational journey: winner in
[scrapbook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrapbooking) competition and
an article on reforming global financial system which he wrote post his
graduation which was published in Financial Express. First event moved him to a
better school and the later to Oxford. This also highlights the importance of
extracurricular activity in one's life; not just academic but also professional
and personal one.

He is a founder & currently president at [Strategic Foresight Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_Foresight_Group);
a think tank based in India that works on global issues that has worked with 60+
countries so far. It is a huge achievement especially from someone who has not come
from a bureaucrat or Indian civil services background.

In 2015, he proposed the United Nations Security council, via Senegal; an African
country, to put water/river as a strategic asset of humanity. See his talk at UN
[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXPm0XCVOD0&t=9).
Listen to [his recent interview (in Marathi)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beYjTW9gLA0&t=1004) for
more latest views.

While most would give full review stars; some like
[Sidhya](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13626166-siddarth-gore], ex-company
colleague has given a different
[review](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/685410402) and IMO he is also
right.
