# Better ethical Avatar for your old phones

There are so many things people can do with their old phones other than throwing
it as e-waste.

This is what I did; to my 3 years old phone; cheapest smart phone from Motorola.
[Moto-E](https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/condor) (Condor) was the perfect
value for money then.

1.  Unlock the official Motorola boot loader. [Link](https://motorola-global-portal.custhelp.com/app/standalone/bootloader/unlock-your-device-c)
2.  Download [TWRP](https://dl.twrp.me/condor/) and flash the recovery software.
3.  Download [LineageOS](https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/condor/install#installing-lineageos-from-recovery) and push to the device.
4.  Finally, wipe existing and install LineageOS.Â 

Once it boots up you will see your old device in reincarnated avatar.

You can begin customizing with installing FDroid. Eg., AndStatus or WaveUp.

This would help you run away from [Surveillance Capitalism](https://ar.al/).
