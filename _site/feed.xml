&lt;p&gt;Recently my father-in-law gave me a Marathi book titled &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17405081-eka-dishecha-shodh&quot;&gt;Ek Dishecha
Shodh&lt;/a&gt; by
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundeep_Waslekar&quot;&gt;Sandeep Waslekar&lt;/a&gt;. Inspiring
and thought provoking book and I would recommend it to all who are seeking some
direction in life. No, I don’t mean it for just civil servant aspirants only but
also for people in mid-life crisis or someone who is still thinking about what’s
next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book, although refers national/international events before 2010, relatively
old in 2021, especially with national politics; it’s a good showcase of an
individual who began his journey from a typical suburban town local school to
a college in Mumbai to Oxford university.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two key events that shaped his educational journey: winner in
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrapbooking&quot;&gt;scrapbook&lt;/a&gt; competition and
an article on reforming global financial system which he wrote post his
graduation which was published in Financial Express. First event moved him to a
better school and the later to Oxford. This also highlights the importance of
extracurricular activity in one’s life; not just academic but also professional
and personal one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He is a founder &amp;amp; currently president at &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_Foresight_Group&quot;&gt;Strategic Foresight Group&lt;/a&gt;;
a think tank based in India that works on global issues that has worked with 60+
countries so far. It is a huge achievement especially from someone who has not come
from a bureaucrat or Indian civil services background.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2015, he proposed the United Nations Security council, via Senegal; an African
country, to put water/river as a strategic asset of humanity. See his talk at UN
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXPm0XCVOD0&amp;amp;t=9&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
Listen to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beYjTW9gLA0&amp;amp;t=1004&quot;&gt;his recent interview (in Marathi)&lt;/a&gt; for
more latest views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While most would give full review stars; some like
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13626166-siddarth-gore&quot;&gt;Sidhya&lt;/a&gt;, ex-company
colleague has given a different
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/685410402&quot;&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; and IMO he is also
right.&lt;/p&gt;
