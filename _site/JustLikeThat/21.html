<p><img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_hiiwYtuYGgs/Rs5t4xUBQKI/AAAAAAAAAEs/lxyGpIE4jVk/s200/5021.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5102136249934758050" border="0" /></p>

<p>It started from  their Jeep, with number plate 5021, which is considered as the
most lucky vehicle that they have ever possessed.  Not having an accident,
better mileage, giving a predictable behavior, and not giving major maintenance
work made it so. They gave credit to the  last two digits of its number plate,
<strong>21</strong>. So now they assume that it is number 21 which makes the thing better.</p>

<p>When family business is in construction domain and when family is joint
generally there are 10 bikes, 4 cars and 4/5 construction machines. Most of the
personal vehicles have <em>5021</em> in RTO number or <em>XX21</em>. But this choice adds many
restrictions sometimes. Like, many a time we have waited for many months until
the number series is available.</p>

<p>This number choice doesn’t restricts to cars but then phones/mobile numbers and
flight seat numbers or rounding transaction such that <em>21</em> is part of it.</p>

<p>But this bias about numbers grabs attention everything it appears anywhere.</p>

<p>Eg., I found this excellent book which explains Bitcoin so well and its named as
<a href="https://21lessons.com/">21 Lessons</a>.</p>

<p>The number has some mathematical properties <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/21_(number)">21
Number</a> has a special page on the
wikipedia.</p>

<p>It mentions the number is
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number">Fibonacci</a>, Triangular Number (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6) and many more special properties.</p>

<p>BTW, both summer/winter solstices fall on 21st June and Dec respectively.</p>

<p>Finally, for crypto enthusiasts, the total number of Bitcoin to be released is
21 million.</p>

<p>The number 21 has also <a href="https://crossasia-journals.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php/ejvs/article/viewFile/396/391">significance in Hindu
scriptures</a>
and <a href="https://bhargavasarma.blogspot.com/2013/09/significance-of-21-in-worship-of-lord.html">in the worship of Lord
Ganesha</a>.</p>
