# I was Just lucky

It was 5:30 PM and I was at my office at Yerawada (Marvell). I got on my bike
and started for home. There are around 15 traffic signals on the way. Following
is my office-home route.

So It was 5:30 PM and I was at home at 6:00 PM. Well it wasn't a holiday or
wasn't city in blackout forcing all the traffic signals off. Instead All the
signals were in working condition. But believe or not; each and everyÂ traffic
signal I got yesterday was Green.

I was just lucky.
