<p>There is always room for improvement for everybody.</p>

<p>I have been riding bikes since my school days. But I was introduced to a real
bike three year ago by a friend who possessed one and I asked for a ride. By the
time I returned from that 10 minutes ride, I was in love with it.</p>

<p>Although the bike was very much different from other bikes that I rode, had to
kick 10 times before it got started, had gears and brakes on the wrong side and
it was as heavy as riding it with a Yokozuna at the back, I made a decision to
own one. Years after it, I was a proud owner of “Royal Enfield’s Bullet 350
STD”.</p>

<p>More complex a thing is, the more time it needs to learn. And, the more time one
invests, the more dear the thing becomes. True for all; relations, winning
strategies and Bullets. This real bike demands a relationship with its rider.
The relationship involves patience. In return one will get pleasure that only a
beast rider may get.</p>

<p>It is twenty thousand KM old now, with experience of flying at 120 KMPH,
Stamping the highest and toughest road of Leh-Ladakh and walking steadily with
mileage 35-42 KMPL.</p>

<p>It’s rightly said, Bullet is a bike with a huge heart. And Don’t bleed her heart
by riding it like the rest of the plastic bikes. Some of the easy riding tips
are as follows.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Do not throttle the engine immediately after the start. Ride a couple of KMs
with low throttle and with appropriate gear.</li>
  <li>Clutch should be used only while changing the gear.</li>
  <li>For going above 60 KM, make sure that your bike is warm enough. Eg., 10 Km
with 50, another 5 Km with 60 and then you can go up to 140 :).</li>
  <li>For mileage drive within 40-50 Kmph on top gear, make use of momentum instead
of always-throttle-style.</li>
  <li>For braking use both the breaks.</li>
  <li>For turns at high speed, have an inside bend and slightly turn the handle in
the opposite direction.</li>
  <li>Have Oil changed (engine, gear, clutch) after every 3000 Km.</li>
  <li>Higher air pressure in the tyre will result in higher mileage but weaker
control. So use appropriate air pressure. I use 32 and 26 PSI in the rear and
front tyres. Will vary based on rider’s Weight.</li>
  <li>Regularly tighten the loose parts/nuts/bolts and replace damaged parts.</li>
  <li>Always wear a helmet and enjoy the thump at 40-50 KMPH.</li>
</ol>

<p>As I said, there is always room for improvement for everybody, please correct me
if I am wrong.</p>
