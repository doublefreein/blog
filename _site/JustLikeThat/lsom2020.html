<p>Hello Runners,</p>

<p>We are all super excited to organize March LSoM 2020. We have identified couple
of core areas where current LSoM structure can be improved</p>

<ol>
  <li>How can we reach local communities better?</li>
  <li>How can those have access to the event who can not afford the ticket?</li>
</ol>

<p>Conventional social media propaganda reaches to the same people/groups. Instead
of spending efforts on online promotion; we can go back to basics and spend
efforts on offline promotion of not just the event but also share a few good
things about running.</p>

<p>We can reach most of the nearby (say 5km radius) schools and
yoga/running/laughter clubs. Because the count of such groups will be more it
can not be a single day event or can not be done by only a selected few.</p>

<p>Idea is to Share the benefit of running and/or share an experience that changed
people’s life because of running and motivate people to join us.</p>

<p>We can run this activity in a purely decentralized and distributed way for the entire
LSoM month; From previous LSoM to this.</p>

<p>Following could work</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create multiple mini-groups of 4/5 runners from each running group involved
in LSoM</li>
  <li>We can find a list of schools/colleges/groups nearby.</li>
  <li>Catch these local groups on suitable time; talk with them; share some
presentation if exists; give them some free passes for needy or for those
who can not afford the tickets.</li>
  <li>Finally, Share the numbers, Take the snaps and spread this on the social
media</li>
</ol>

<p>We are working towards getting roughly 15% free passes; eg., 300 free passes for
total of 2000 runners.</p>

<p>We feel doing such offline activities would be fun and would definitely give a
new experience of life.</p>

<p>Let’s make this LSoM more interactive. Let’s go out and connect with people
directly.</p>

<p>Let us know your view on this.</p>

<hr />

<p>PS: This event was cancelled due to Covid19 Lockdown in India in March 2020.</p>
