<p>I have been reading this book, “Shantaram, by Gregory David Robers”, since last
two years. Its not that I can’t read fast, but I would love to enjoy the book
for a long time. It is literary a masterpiece.</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>If you make your heart a weapon, you always end up using it on yourself
</code></pre></div></div>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>The Universe began in utmost simplicity and it is moving towards the ultimate
complexity. This ultimate complexity is what we calls as God
</code></pre></div></div>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Fate always gives us 2 choices, 1 which we take and other which we should have taken
</code></pre></div></div>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>I don't know what frightens me more, the power that crushes us or our endless
ability to endure it.
</code></pre></div></div>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>India is a country where HEART  is KING
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>One will find at least one beautiful quote on every single page of this book and
the book has over 900 pages ;).</p>

<p>Sometimes odd things make a hard impression us. I have played many car racing
games on computer but my favorite car race is from a non-car-racing-game, in
fact a mafia game named as “Mafia”. Like wise, I have come across lot of reading
material about my second love,”Royal Enfield Bullet”, over Internet or
Advertisements or Blogs, but the one that made its impression is from this book,
Shantaram.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>The Enfield of India 350cc Bullet was a single-cylinder, four-stroke motorcycle,
constructed to the plans of the original 1050s' model of the British Royal
Enfield. Renowned for its idiosyncratic handling as much as for its reliability
and durability, the Bullet was a bike that demanded relationship with its rider.
That relationship involved tolerance, patience, and understanding on the part of
the rider. In exchange, the Bullet provided the kind of soaring, celestial,
wind-weaving pleasure that birds must know, punctured by not infrequent
near-death experience.
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>He has correctly expressed my exact experience with bullet 350, the thumping
machine.</p>
