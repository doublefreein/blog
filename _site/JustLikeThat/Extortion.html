<p>Yesterday’s Da Vinci code movie helped me cherish my memory of the book that I read years before. Their attempt of covering 300 pages of the book in just 3 hours was worth appreciating. Movie finished at 1:15 am and I was in bed at 1:30 am. That means it took just 15 minutes to cover the distance from E-square to Vadgaon-budruk. After all, I am proud of my driving skill. Driving is not easy one has to know all the rules, on and off the paper; i.e., the car will take the turn only if it has given an appropriate indicator. But do all drivers follow the rules?
In spite of going to bed late yesterday, I was ready to go to work today at 9am. But dad wanted me to go to the Bank at Kothrud where it took 40 mins to finish up the given work. So now the new task is to reach the company before 10am. Even though I knew that the shortest path does not always yield the quickest path; I chose Paud road to reach highways; then to enter into Pashan and then to AirTight at aundh through AbhimanShree society.</p>

<p>Everything was going according to plan until I hit an Indica near the very last fountain circle at paud road. It happened so that i was going 40kmph (with positive acceleration) while overtaking the car as I saw enough space between the car and the fountain which was on my right. But suddenly the car took a right turn and very next moment my both the palms of the hands were on the ground.</p>

<p>I gave an angry look to the driver expecting him to realize his mistake. But But But the driver and his friend (I guess) got out of the car shouting “Can’t you see the Indicator?”. Now exactly here I got confused since I was 100% sure that before overtaking the car I had seen the indicator; and obviously it was off.
Both levers from my bike were broken. Some two to three scratches on their car with the right side’s rear door had taken some strange shape . With a lot of arguments I found that luck was against me because the place where the accident happened was their area (where these people live). Everybody who was passing on the road used to stop and ask them about the matter but nobody asked me about it. They gave me two choices: either I should pay the damage or get some beating from them and their friends. And like everybody I choose the first one.
We went to a mechanic who said that it will take 1300 Rs to repair the damage. That is that dumb mechanic was asking the amount which was equal to the resale value of that car. Even though I had to settle it down to 1000 Rs. Apart from that another 120 Rs were included in loss as the cost for repair work of my bike.
So in short the incident brought another proof for Charle Darwin’s survival of fittest theory. I have learned two things from this incident. First, never go by the roads where people are not strangers to each other. Since they cooperate with each other to win the lost match. And unlike me, people won’t drive their vehicle by the book ,i.e. the off indicator does not mean that these Jackasses wont turn.</p>
