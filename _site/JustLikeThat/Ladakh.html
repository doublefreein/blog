Initially road was ok but after an hour of riding we came to know why
internet says its hard to pass Rohtang; One feet muddy roads, Traffic
Jams, Road block because of melting of ice, 45 degrees roads ;) and
chilling cold. Every time our shoes got wet we had to replace socks and
if possible shoes. Encountered little snowfall on the top. Had to
tighten clutch cords twice while crossing the pass.</p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>16:00 Had lunch after descending the Rohtang on the other side. Typical dal rice.</li>
      <li>18:00 Removed Puncture of one the Unicorns.</li>
      <li>18:15 Started from Keylong. It get dark little late there. We decided to
cover 45 Km in the evening/night. Road was risky but had no option of
staying anywhere on the road; It was damn cold.</li>
      <li>21:30 Reached Keylong and found a hotel for shelter ;). Then as usual
food + Old Monk :) and good night sleep</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>19 June 2009
    <ul>
      <li>12:00 All bikes were made tank full as next petrol pump was 365 KM away
:O. Had go back 7 Km for finding the petrol pump from Keylong. My
bullets clutch plate was in bad condition, had to throttle a lot for
steep rise and also there was only one mechanic @ Keylong, also named
Yogesh, and was overcrowded. So decided to stretch the bikes till Leh.
We had left with very little cash, as our assumption of finding an ATM
at Keylong was wrong. We borrowed some cash from hotel owner instead of
paying him the hotel and food bill. Such nicer people will only find in
that areas.</li>
      <li>2:00 Started for Leh and decided to reach Sarchu by EOD.</li>
      <li>5:00 Had to stop at a tent near Zinzunbar as road ahead was blocked due
to avelanche. There was all ice outside the tent. Some how manged to get
Dal-Rice for dinner in the tent itself. Night was terribly cold, owner
said temperature that night was -10 degrees :(. Rahul had breething
problem. Many had headache, cold and

visor were used with vapours; If we keep it open, there was chilling
cold wind hitting the face. My bike go sleeped over a ice block after
crossing Barallachla. Cloths got wet, wanter went inside shoes. Had to
cross many water streams flowing across the road.</li>
      <li>11:30 Reached Sarchu. Had lunch, dried our cloths, shoes and socks.
Rahuls breathing problem was still there, more than that, he was
vometing everything that he ate.</li>

were severely damaged when we got the bikes in Pune that too after 15
days :(). And we started our roaring train journey to Pune with nothing
but the sweet memories of Beautiful valley.</li>
