<p>Many (old) schools are troubling to adjust with this forced digitization of
education due to covid pandemic. Answers to everything can not be a WhatsApp
group or zoom calls.</p>

<p>This is a Howto on enabling minimal online education for schools.</p>

<h3 id="have-lms-if-possible">Have LMS if possible</h3>

<p>For example, <em>Moodle</em> is feature rich learning management solution; its #FLOSS
and can even be self hosted https://docs.moodle.org/39/en/Features</p>

<p>But, using it and/or creating content on it has a learning curve especially for
the teachers &amp;/ management who are used to highly engineered  and
addictive-by-design platforms like Facebook,  Whatapp or other social media
apps.</p>

<p>Besides there is also a cost of implementing  &amp;/or maintaining these LMS
platforms which management is trying to avoid given the uncertainty of the
pandemic timeline.</p>

<h3 id="have-a-minimal-website-or-web-page-or-a-blog-page">Have a minimal website or web-page or a blog page</h3>

<p>Announcements can be made here and its link can be shared in SMS/Chat. Website
provides ways to correct the contents once posted.</p>

<p>One can explore good old blogging platforms like Github, WordPress or Blogger;
which are free and don’t require viewers to have a login.</p>

<h3 id="avoid-remote-classes-using-real-time-internet-tools">Avoid remote classes using real time Internet tools</h3>

<p>Forget the Internet, most students will not have access to computers or even a
mobile on specified time.</p>

<p>So dont design courses with live video/audio communication. Having it will
benefit only a limited few.</p>

<h3 id="focus-on-remote-assessment-or-progress">Focus on remote assessment or progress</h3>

<p>Let teachers decide a topic/subtopic with reference from the books and provide
questions or quizzes around that topic to assess the students progress. Chase
parents for tracking their child’s progress.</p>

<h3 id="creating-a-good-video-content-is-difficult-and-costly">Creating a good video content is difficult and costly.</h3>

<p>It’s better to share links of existing good public domain contents than making
teachers create one.</p>

<p>Ideally, it should be the responsibility of the education board/universities to
provide the digital contents just like the books.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://merge.diksha.gov.in/">Diksha</a></strong> has too good contents and its an
initiative of the National Council of Educational Research and Training
Ministry of Education, Govt of India. <em>They have done a really good work</em>.</p>

<h3 id="dont-share-course-content--videos-on-whatsapp">Don’t share course content &amp; videos on WhatsApp</h3>

<p>Use WA for just chatting and sharing links. Create content on  Upload videos on
YouTube. Make comments/like disabled.</p>

<h3 id="focus-on-inclusion">Focus on inclusion</h3>

<p>Students with access to resources like the Internet, computers or parents
who-teach-their-kids would definitely have an edge over others without it. In
this pandandemic situation, let teachers help the ones without right access.</p>

<p>If scaling is the problem, let the school run some mentorship program.
Senior-students/parents/volunteers can reach the specific students in need.</p>
