<p><em>Alumni</em> <em>of Sainik School Satara are called Ajinkyans.</em>  </p>

<p><a href="https://ajinkyans.in/">Ajinkyans.in</a> is a micro-blogging platform where
individuals can connect with the rest of the Ajinkyans and express their
thoughts. It is designed to bring all the Ajinkyans on a single platform for
better communication and information sharing. It’s a social network exclusive
for the community. It’s powerful, secure and salable.</p>

<ul>
  <li>  It doesn’t track you (No location or GPS needed)</li>
  <li>  It doesn’t require your private information (eg., Phone number, Home
addresses)</li>
  <li>  Its build on Free and Open source technology (The code is open)</li>
  <li>  No advertisement &amp; No Spams  </li>
  <li>  Platform is trusted and used by millions  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="arent-we-already-connected-over-whatsapp-or-telegram">Aren’t we already connected over Whatsapp or Telegram?</h3>

<p>Yes, you are. But with limited individuals and with limited groups. It is still
a small subset of our entire community.</p>

<p>Whatsapp and Telegram can not connect the entire community mainly because of two
key design problems.</p>

<p>First, it is a broadcast communication medium by default; which means every
single message is delivered to every other member of the group and this could be
a noise for some. How tough we set the group rules they are difficult to
enforce.</p>

<p>Second problem is there is a limit on the maximum number of individuals who can
be a part of the group; roughly capped to 250. But remember, the bigger the
group, the more unwanted or non-interested conversations that will happen.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-micro-blogging">What is micro-blogging?</h3>

<p>A micro-blog differs from a traditional blog in that its content is typically
smaller in both actual and aggregated file size. Micro-blogs “allow users to
exchange small elements of content such as short sentences, individual images,
or video links”. Individual can share his thoughts using a micro-post or a
series of micro posts called a thread.</p>

<h3 id="how-does-this-social-network-work">How does this social network work?</h3>

<p>Every individual has an unique handle (a.k.a username) on the platform.
Generally referred to with ‘@` at its prefix. Eg., @yogeshpowar or @admin. An
individual can follow any other individual on the platform. Likewise, an
individual can also be followed by any other individual.</p>

<p>An individual can only see the posts that are shared by the ones he is
following. Eg., there 1000 individuals on the platform but only 50 of them are
the ones you follow. Then you will see the post only from those 50.</p>

<p>Any post that you make will automatically be shared to your followers. Similarly
if you find some interesting post then you can re-post for your followers to get
it.</p>

<p>An individual can re-post, reply and like any post.</p>

<p>An individual can follow, un-follow, message and direct message any individual.</p>

<h3 id="is-it-similar-to-twitter">Is it similar to Twitter?</h3>

<p>Yes, Twitter is a popular micro-blogging social network. The platform is run
using a Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) named Mastodon. Unlike Twitter,
its’ a private social network; accessible only for Ajinkyans community. This
software is hosted on our server. Which means we, the community, own the data.</p>

<p>Did you know that the micro post on Mastodon is called Toot.</p>

<p>Only Ajinkyans can be part of this network. Registration is not open to the
public.</p>
