<p>A friend of mine wanted my help on installing Gnu/Linux on one of his new
laptops. He had already installed <em>Windows 7</em> on it and tried installing
<em>Ubuntu</em> on it which had consistently failed to boot in normal or rescue mode.</p>

<p>After doing some research on the Internet, I found that people have faced
similar problems using similar hardware. I tried a fresh installation of
<em>Ubuntu</em> <em>14.04</em> (the latest) and it showed the same behaviour. That is <strong><em>no
activity on screen after loading initrd.</em></strong> The same behavior was seen even for
<em>Archlinux</em>.</p>

<p>All this time I was trying to boot using the BIOS method. Some post on the
Internet have mentioned correct working of <em>Ubuntu</em> provided one use <em>EFI</em>
method. <em>UEFI</em> method requires <em>EFI partition</em> which is a <em>DOS FAT32</em> and
requires <em>GPT</em> formatted disk.</p>

<p>It was clear then that disk would be reformatted. All I had to do was to boot
the machine using <em>EFI</em> method and then <em>Ubuntu</em> installation would be taking
care of the rest. Eventually it did but by removing entire data from disk
without giving me any warning. And it stupidly took all the share of the disk by
keeping 500MB for the EFI partition and the remaining 1 TB for itself.</p>

<p>Live <em>Ubuntu</em> CD again came for the rescue.</p>

<p>I had to fix it by first resizing the <em>EXT4</em> using <em>resize2fs</em> and then fixing
the partition table using the <em>parted</em> to match the partition size with that of
file systems. To know file system size, used <em>dump2fs</em> to find block count and
multiplied it by block size. Then created a few more partitions for swap and etc
using parted; <em>fdisk</em> doesn’t work on GPT disks (why?)</p>

<p>Formatted the newly created swap partition using <em>mkswap</em> and fixed the
<em>/etc/fstab</em> file with its correct <em>UUID</em> and rebooted the machine to see the
<em>Ubuntu 14.04</em> up and running.</p>

<p><strong>Happy hacking</strong>.</p>
