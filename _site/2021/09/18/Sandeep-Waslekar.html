      <section>
        <h1 id="sandeep-waslekar">Sandeep Waslekar</h1>

<p>Recently my father-in-law gave me a Marathi book titled <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17405081-eka-dishecha-shodh">Ek Dishecha
Shodh</a> by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundeep_Waslekar">Sandeep Waslekar</a>. Inspiring
and thought provoking book and I would recommend it to all who are seeking some
direction in life. No, I don’t mean it for just civil servant aspirants only but
also for people in mid-life crisis or someone who is still thinking about what’s
next.</p>

<p>The book, although refers national/international events before 2010, relatively
old in 2021, especially with national politics; it’s a good showcase of an
individual who began his journey from a typical suburban town local school to
a college in Mumbai to Oxford university.</p>

<p>Two key events that shaped his educational journey: winner in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrapbooking">scrapbook</a> competition and
an article on reforming global financial system which he wrote post his
graduation which was published in Financial Express. First event moved him to a
better school and the later to Oxford. This also highlights the importance of
extracurricular activity in one’s life; not just academic but also professional
and personal one.</p>

<p>He is a founder &amp; currently president at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_Foresight_Group">Strategic Foresight Group</a>;
a think tank based in India that works on global issues that has worked with 60+
countries so far. It is a huge achievement especially from someone who has not come
from a bureaucrat or Indian civil services background.</p>

<p>In 2015, he proposed the United Nations Security council, via Senegal; an African
country, to put water/river as a strategic asset of humanity. See his talk at UN
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXPm0XCVOD0&amp;t=9">here</a>.
Listen to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beYjTW9gLA0&amp;t=1004">his recent interview (in Marathi)</a> for
more latest views.</p>

<p>While most would give full review stars; some like
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13626166-siddarth-gore">Sidhya</a>, ex-company
colleague has given a different
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/685410402">review</a> and IMO he is also
right.</p>
